# Distribution Network of Stores and Warehouses
A project I made for Stochastic Optimizations class. Given a sheet of data including a distance matrix, and coordinates of stores and warehouses, determine the paths each vehicle must take to ensure the least amount of daily cost for the company.

Currently, there are some calculation errors for the distance between the last store visited and the final warehouse that the vehicle stops at.

The files included here are the report on the process of developing a solution for this problem, the data for this problem in an excel sheet, and the code used for this report.
