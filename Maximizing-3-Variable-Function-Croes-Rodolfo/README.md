# Maximizing 3 Variable Function Stochastically
A project I made for Stochastic Optimizations class. Using different search algorithms, find the combination of variables to produce the largest output in the given bounds.

The files included here are the report on the process of finding the maximum value of this function and the code for the search algorithms.
