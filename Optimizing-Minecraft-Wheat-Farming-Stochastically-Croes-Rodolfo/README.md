# Optimizing Minecraft Wheat Farming Stochastically
A project I made for Stochastic Optimizations class. Determine at what time, on average, should the player harvest all the crops in the maximum size farm with one water block in the middle, to maximize production while minimizing the time that the fully grown crops stay unharvested.

The files included here are the report on the process of developing a solution for this problem, and the code used for this problem.
