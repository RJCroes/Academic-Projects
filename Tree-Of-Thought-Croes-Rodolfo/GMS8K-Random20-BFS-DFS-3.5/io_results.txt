Ground Truth: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
Generated Solution: Answer:
Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream per night, so she will finish one carton of ice cream in 15 nights.
Since each carton costs $4.00, she will spend $4.00 every 15 nights.
In 60 days, there are 4 sets of 15 nights, so she will spend 4 x $4.00 = $16.00 on ice cream.
The answer is 16.

Task 135: 1.00
Ground Truth: If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.
#### 40
Generated Solution: Answer:
Since Brian lost 5 video games, he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.
Bobby has 3 * 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 video games.
The answer is 40.

Task 1203: 1.00
Ground Truth: Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.
#### 240
Generated Solution: Answer:
The height of Mattison's two-story house is 60 inches x 7 = 420 inches.
The height from the first floor's floor to the ceiling is 60 inches x 3 = 180 inches.
Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.
The answer is 240.

Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: Answer:
If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take one person 10 days to paint a whole house. Therefore, if 5 people are working together, it would take them 2 days to paint a whole house.
The answer is 2.

Ground Truth: The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.
#### 260
Generated Solution: Answer:
Total cost for 2 implants: $2000 x 2 = $4000
Cost for porcelain crown: $500
Remaining balance: $4000 + $500 - $600 = $3900
Hours needed to work: $3900 / $15 = 260
The answer is 260

Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples â€“ 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: Answer:
Let x be the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.
From the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30 apples.
From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered 30/2 = 15 apples.
From the average trees, Joanne gathered x apples.
From the tallest trees, Joanne's sister gathered 2*30 = 60 apples.
From the shortest trees, Joanne's sister gathered 3*15 = 45 apples.
The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500.
Therefore, 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
x = 350
The answer is 350.

Task 409: 0.10
Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May:
40 employees * $15 per hour * 40 hours per week * 4 weeks in May = $24,000

To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June:
1/4 * 40 employees = 10 employees
30 employees * $15 per hour * 40 hours per week * 4 weeks in June = $18,000

Total amount paid in May and June:
$24,000 (May) + $18,000 (June) = $42,000

The answer is $42,000

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: Answer:
Blake runs a total of 3000 yards (15 times back and forth on a 100-yard field), while Kelly runs a total of 1360 yards (34 times to the 40-yard line and back). Therefore, the winner, Blake, runs 1640 yards farther than Kelly.
The answer is 1640.

Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120

So they take 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 minutes together
The last 2 sides take 5/2=<<5/2=2.5>>2.5 minutes
So they take 2.5*2=<<2.5*2=5>>5 minutes
So the total time is 5+20+5=<<5+20+5=30>>30 minutes
#### 30

Task 455: 1.00
Ground Truth: Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.
#### 1920
Generated Solution: First, we need to calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds. 

Volume of one raised bed = 2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet = 32 cubic feet
Total volume needed for 10 raised beds = 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Next, we need to calculate how many bags of potting soil Bob needs to buy. 

Number of bags needed = Total volume needed / Volume of one bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the potting soil. 

Total cost = Number of bags needed x Cost per bag = 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920

The answer is $1920.

Ground Truth: Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.
#### 8
Generated Solution: Answer:
Let x be the number of chocolate bars in a box. 
Lisa sold 3.5x chocolate bars and Peter sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 
The total number of chocolate bars sold is 3.5x + 4.5x = 64. 
Solving for x:
3.5x + 4.5x = 64
8x = 64
x = 8
Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box. The answer is 8.

Ground Truth: Mariahâ€™s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.
#### 273
Generated Solution: Answer:
Mariah used 91 yards of yarn and her grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Ground Truth: Maxâ€™s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.
Cookie Monsterâ€™s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.
Summerâ€™s total cookie amount is 73+23 = <<73+23=96>>96.
Total amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.
#### 298
Generated Solution: Answer: 
If Katarina has 68 cookies, then Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.
In total, they have 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.
The answer is 298.
