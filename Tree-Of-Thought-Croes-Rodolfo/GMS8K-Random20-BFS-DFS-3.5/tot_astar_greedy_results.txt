Ground Truth: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the cost per serving of ice cream by dividing the cost of each carton by the number of servings it contains.
2. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days by multiplying the number of servings she eats per day by the number of days.
3. Multiply the total number of servings by the cost per serving to find the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream in 60 days.

Answer:
Cost per serving = $4.00 / 15 servings = $0.27 per serving
Number of servings consumed in 60 days = 1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings
Total amount spent on ice cream in 60 days = 60 servings * $0.27 = $16.20
The answer is 16.20

Task 1203: 1.00
Ground Truth: Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.
#### 240
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we will first find the height of the two-story house and then subtract the height of the first floor. We know that the two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so we will multiply his height by 7 to find the total height. Then, we will find the height of the first floor by multiplying Mattison's height by 3. Finally, we will subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.
Answer:
60 inches * 7 = 420 inches
60 inches * 3 = 180 inches
420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches
The answer is 240

Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: Strategy:
First, calculate how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. Then, divide that time by the number of people painting to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

Answer:
One person can paint half a house in 5 days, so it would take one person 10 days to paint a whole house. Since there are 5 people painting, it would take them 10 days divided by 5 people, which is 2 days to paint a whole house. 
The answer is 2.

Ground Truth: The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.
#### 260
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work by adding the base price of two implants ($2000 each), the cost of one porcelain crown ($500), and subtracting the deposit George has already made ($600).
2. Calculate how much money George will need to earn to cover the remaining cost of the dental work.
3. Divide the remaining cost by George's hourly wage ($15) to determine how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work.

Answer:
The total cost of the dental work is $2000 + $2000 + $500 - $600 = $3900.
George needs to earn $3900 - $600 = $3300 to cover the remaining cost.
George needs to work $3300 / $15 = 220 hours to pay for the dental work.
The answer is 220.

Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Let x be the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.
2. From the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30 apples and her sister gathered 2*30 = 60 apples.
3. From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered 30/2 = 15 apples and her sister gathered 3*15 = 45 apples.
4. Joanne gathered x apples from the average trees, while her sister did not gather any.
5. The total number of apples gathered is 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500.
6. Solve for x using the equation obtained in step 5.

Ground Truth: Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes
Warm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes
3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes
3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes
Ray takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer
#### 54
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.
2. Find the difference in time between swimming a mile in cold water and warm water.
3. Multiply this difference by 3 to find how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.

Answer:
When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold, which is 16 minutes * 2 + 2 = 34 minutes.
The difference in time between swimming a mile in cold water (16 minutes) and warm water (34 minutes) is 34 - 16 = 18 minutes.
Therefore, Ray takes 18 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.
The answer is 18.

Task 409: 0.40
Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May by multiplying the number of employees (40) by their hourly rate ($15) by the number of hours worked (40).
2. Calculate the total amount paid to employees in June by determining how many employees had contracts expire (1/4 of 40) and subtracting this number from the total number of employees. Then, multiply this number by their hourly rate ($15) by the number of hours worked (40).
3. Add the total amount paid to employees in May and June together to get the final answer.

Answer:
The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $72,000. The answer is 72000.

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran and then find the difference between the two. We will calculate the total distance Blake ran by multiplying the number of times he ran back and forth by the distance of the football field. We will then calculate the total distance Kelly ran by adding the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back, multiplied by the number of times she did it. Finally, we will subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance to find out how much farther the winner ran.

Answer:
The winner runs 700 yards farther than the loser. The answer is 700.

Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has at the beginning: 200 shoes.
2. Calculate the total number of shoes he gains throughout the week: 5 pairs on Monday + 15 pairs on Wednesday + 30 pairs on Friday = 50 pairs = 100 shoes.
3. Subtract the number of shoes he gets rid of on Saturday: 200 - 180 = 20 shoes.
4. Determine how many shoes he will have on Sunday: 20 + 100 = 120 shoes.
