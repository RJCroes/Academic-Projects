Ground Truth: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia will need for 60 days.
2. Multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost.

Output:
Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so she will consume 60 servings of ice cream in 60 days. Since each carton has 15 servings, she will need 4 cartons of ice cream for 60 days. At $4.00 per carton, Cynthia will spend a total of $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.
The answer is 16.

Ground Truth: Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.
#### 240
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the height of Mattison in inches (60 inches).
2. Calculate the height of the two-story house by multiplying Mattison's height by 7 (60 inches x 7 = 420 inches).
3. Calculate the height from the first floor's floor to the ceiling by multiplying Mattison's height by 3 (60 inches x 3 = 180 inches).
4. Subtract the height from the first floor's floor to the ceiling from the total height of the two-story house to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof (420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches).

Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: Strategy:
First, calculate how many days it would take one person to paint a whole house. Then, divide that number by 5 to find out how many days it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. Finally, convert the number of days into hours by multiplying by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day).

Answer:
It would take one person 10 days to paint a whole house. Therefore, it would take 5 people 2 days to paint a whole house. Multiplying 2 days by 24 hours gives us 48 hours.
The answer is 48

Ground Truth: The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.
#### 260
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work by adding up the base price of the implants ($2000 each), the cost of the porcelain crown ($500), and subtracting the deposit George has already made ($600).
2. Determine how much money George still needs to save by subtracting the amount he has already paid from the total cost.
3. Calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount by dividing the total amount needed by George's hourly wage of $15.

Answer:
Total cost of dental work = (2 implants x $2000/implant) + $500 - $600
Total cost of dental work = $4000 + $500 - $600
Total cost of dental work = $3900

Amount still needed to save = $3900 - $600
Amount still needed to save = $3300

Hours needed to work = $3300 / $15/hr
Hours needed to work = 220

The answer is 220

Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Let x be the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.
2. From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
   - Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, x/2 apples from the shortest trees, and x apples from the average trees.
   - Joanne's sister gathered 2*30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees and 3*(x/2) = 3x/2 apples from the shortest trees.
   - The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 30 + 0.5x + x + 60 + 1.5x = 500.
3. Solve the system of equations to find the value of x, which represents the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

Ground Truth: Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes
Warm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes
3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes
3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes
Ray takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer
#### 54
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a warm day by using the information given. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes on a cold day, on a warm day he swims a mile in 2(16) + 2 = 34 minutes.
2. Determine how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day. Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles on a cold day, it would take him 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.
3. Find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day to determine how much longer Ray takes on a hot day. Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile on a hot day, so to swim 3 miles on a hot day, it would take him 34 * 3 = 102 minutes. The difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May by multiplying the number of employees (40) by the hourly rate ($15) and the number of hours worked in a week (40).
2. Calculate the total amount paid to employees in June by first determining how many employees had their contracts expire (1/4 of 40) and subtracting that number from the total number of employees in May. Then, multiply the remaining number of employees by the hourly rate and the number of hours worked in a week.
3. Add the total amount paid in May to the total amount paid in June to get the overall total amount paid to employees in the two months.

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran in 15 minutes. Then we will subtract the distance run by the loser from the distance run by the winner to determine the difference. We will use the given information about the number of times each person ran back and forth on the football field to calculate the total distance for both Blake and Kelly. Finally, we will subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance to find the answer.

Answer:
Blake ran a total distance of 1500 yards (100 yards x 15 times back and forth). Kelly ran a total distance of 1360 yards (40 yards x 34 times). 
Therefore, the difference in distance run by the winner and the loser is 140 yards.

Task 468: 0.20
Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of shoes gained by Fireman Frank throughout the week: 5 pairs on Monday (10 shoes), 15 pairs on Wednesday (30 shoes), and 30 pairs on Friday (60 shoes). Total shoes gained = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.
2. Subtract the total number of shoes gained (100) from the total number of shoes Frank had at the beginning of the week (200). 200 - 100 = 100 shoes.
3. Subtract the number of shoes Frank gets rid of on Saturday (180) from the result obtained in step 2 (100). 100 - 180 = -80 shoes.
4. The final result will be the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday. Since negative shoes do not make sense, we can conclude that Fireman Frank will have 0 shoes on Sunday.
