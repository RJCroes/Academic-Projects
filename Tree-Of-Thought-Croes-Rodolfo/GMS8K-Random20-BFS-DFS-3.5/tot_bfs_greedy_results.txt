Ground Truth: If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.
#### 40
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how many video games Bobby has by finding 3 times Brian's initial amount (20) and then subtracting 5.
2. Adjust the final answer by adding back the 5 video games Brian lost before the comparison.
3. The final answer will be how many video games Bobby has.

Answer:
3 times Brian's initial amount = 3 * 20 = 60
Bobby has 60 - 5 = 55 video games
Adding back the 5 video games Brian lost, Bobby has 55 + 5 = 60 video games

The answer is 60

Task 527: 1.00
Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To answer this question, we can first calculate how many days it would take for one person to paint a whole house. Then, we can determine how many hours that would be. Finally, we can calculate how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house by dividing the total hours by 5.

Answer:
One person can paint half a house in 5 days, so it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take one person 240 hours to paint a whole house. Therefore, it would take 5 people a total of 48 hours to paint a whole house.

Ground Truth: The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.
#### 260
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work by adding up the base price of the 2 implants and the additional cost for the porcelain crown.
2. Subtract the deposit George has already made from the total cost to determine how much more he needs to pay.
3. Divide the remaining cost by George's hourly wage to determine how many hours he needs to work to cover the cost. Round up to the nearest whole number.

Answer:
Total cost = (2 implants x $2000) + $500 = $4500
Remaining cost = Total cost - deposit = $4500 - $600 = $3900
Hours needed to work = $3900 / $15 = 260 hours

Task 415: 0.70
Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Let x be the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.
2. From the information given, we know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, which means she gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees.
3. Joanne's total number of apples is therefore 30 (tallest trees) + 15 (shortest trees) + x (average trees).
4. Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which means she gathered 60 apples from the tallest trees. She also gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which means she gathered 45 apples from the shortest trees.
5. The total number of apples that the sisters gathered is 30 (Joanne's tallest trees) + 60 (sister's tallest trees) + 15 (Joanne's shortest trees) + 45 (sister's shortest trees) + x (Joanne's average trees) = 500.
6. Use the above equations to solve for x to find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

Answer:
After solving the equations, we find that Joanne gathered 120 apples from the average trees.

Ground Truth: Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes
Warm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes
3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes
3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes
Ray takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer
#### 54
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To answer the question, I will first calculate how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a warm day. Then, I will calculate how long it takes him to swim 3 miles on both a cold and warm day. Finally, I will subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes on a warm day to find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.

Answer:
On a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day, so he swims a mile in 16 + 2 = 18 minutes on a warm day.
Therefore, on a cold day, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim 1 mile and on a warm day, it takes him 18 minutes to swim 1 mile.
Swimming 3 miles on a cold day takes Ray 16 x 3 = 48 minutes.
Swimming 3 miles on a warm day takes Ray 18 x 3 = 54 minutes.
Therefore, Ray takes 54 - 48 = 6 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total amount paid to all employees in May by multiplying the number of employees (40) by their pay per hour ($15) and the number of hours worked (40).
2. Calculate the total amount paid to all employees in June by first finding the number of employees whose contracts expired (1/4 of 40 = 10), then subtracting that number from the total number of employees in May (40 - 10 = 30). Finally, multiply the remaining number of employees (30) by their pay per hour ($15) and the number of hours worked (40).
3. Add the total amount paid in May ($24,000) to the total amount paid in June ($18,000) to get the overall total amount paid to the employees in the two months.

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran and then compare the two totals. We will calculate the total distance Blake ran by multiplying the number of times he ran back and forth by the length of the football field. We will then calculate the total distance Kelly ran by adding up the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back for each round. Finally, we will subtract the total distance Kelly ran from the total distance Blake ran to find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser.

Answer:
Blake ran a total of 1500 yards (100 yards x 15 times), while Kelly ran a total of 1360 yards (40 yards x 34 times). Therefore, the winner ran 140 yards farther than the loser.

Task 468: 1.00
Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have after each day's acquisitions and removals.
2. Subtract the 180 shoes he gets rid of on Saturday from the total shoes he has on Friday to get the final count for Sunday.

Answer:
After Monday: 200 + (5 pairs * 2 shoes/pair) = 210 shoes
After Wednesday: 210 + (15 pairs * 2 shoes/pair) = 240 shoes
After Friday: 240 + (30 pairs * 2 shoes/pair) = 300 shoes
After Saturday: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes

Ground Truth: The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes
So they take 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 minutes together
The last 2 sides take 5/2=<<5/2=2.5>>2.5 minutes
So they take 2.5*2=<<2.5*2=5>>5 minutes
So the total time is 5+20+5=<<5+20+5=30>>30 minutes
#### 30
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. First side: 5 minutes
2. Second side: 2 * 5 = 10 minutes

Ground Truth: A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning you will save 20/100*$400=$<<20/100*400=80>>80 if you make your own hand-painted wallpaper.
The total cost of a hand-painted wallpaper made at home is $400-$80 = $<<400-80=320>>320
#### 320
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find the total cost of Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper, first calculate the 20% savings from the original cost of $400. Subtract this savings from the original cost to find the total cost of materials. Then, add the cost of materials to any additional costs, such as tools or supplies, to determine the total cost.
