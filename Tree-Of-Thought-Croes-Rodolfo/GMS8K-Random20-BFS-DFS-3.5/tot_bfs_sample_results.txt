Ground Truth: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the cost of one serving of ice cream by dividing the total cost of a carton by the number of servings.
2. Multiply the cost of one serving by the number of servings Cynthia consumes in a night to determine her nightly cost.
3. Multiply her nightly cost by the number of nights in 60 days to find the total amount she will spend on ice cream over that period.

Answer:
Cost of one serving = $4.00 / 15 servings = $0.27
Nightly cost = $0.27 x 1 serving = $0.27
Total cost over 60 days = $0.27 x 60 days = $16.20

The answer is 16.

Ground Truth: Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.
#### 240
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the height of the two-story house by multiplying Mattison's height by 7.
2. Calculate the height of the first floor's ceiling by multiplying Mattison's height by 3.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor's ceiling from the total height of the two-story house to find the height from the first floor's floor to the second floor's floor.
4. Add Mattison's height to the height from the first floor's floor to the second floor's floor to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

Answer:
Mattison's height: 60 inches
Two-story house height: 60 inches x 7 = 420 inches
First floor ceiling height: 60 inches x 3 = 180 inches
Height from first floor to second floor: 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches
Roof height from second floor: 240 inches + 60 inches = 300 inches
The answer is 300.

Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: Strategy:
First, calculate how many days it would take one person to paint a whole house. Then, divide that by the number of people (5) to determine how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Finally, convert the number of days to hours by multiplying by 24 since each day has 24 hours.

Answer:
It would take 2.5 days for one person to paint a whole house. Therefore, it would take 0.5 days for 5 people to paint a whole house. Converting 0.5 days to hours gives us 12 hours.
The answer is 12.

Task 596: 1.00
Ground Truth: The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.
#### 260
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work by adding up the base price of both implants and the cost of the porcelain crown.
2. Subtract the deposit George has already made from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to pay.
3. Calculate how many hours George needs to work in order to earn the remaining amount needed, based on his hourly wage.

Answer:
Total cost of dental work = (2 implants x $2000) + $500 = $4500
Amount needed to pay = $4500 - $600 = $3900
Hours needed to work = $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours

Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples â€“ 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Let x be the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.
2. From the information given, we know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, which means she gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees.
3. Joanne's total number of apples gathered can be expressed as: 30 (tallest trees) + 15 (shortest trees) + x (average trees).
4. Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which means she gathered 60 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister also gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which means she gathered 45 apples from the shortest trees.
5. The total number of apples gathered by the sisters is 500, so we can create the equation: 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500.
6. Solve for x to find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

Answer:
Solving the equation: 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
Simplifying, we get: x = 350
Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes
3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes
Ray takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer
#### 54
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water.
Time to swim a mile in warm water = 2 + 2(16) = 34 minutes

2. Calculate how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water.
Time to swim 3 miles in warm water = 3(34) = 102 minutes

3. Find the difference between the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water and the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in cold water.
Time to swim 3 miles in cold water = 3(16) = 48 minutes

Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total amount paid to all employees in May by multiplying the number of employees (40) by the hourly rate ($15) and the number of hours worked (40).
2. Calculate how many employees had their contracts expire in June by taking 1/4 of the total number of employees hired in May (40 * 1/4 = 10).
3. Subtract the number of employees whose contracts expired from the total number of employees to find out how many employees were still working in June (40 - 10 = 30).
4. Calculate the total amount paid to the employees who were still working in June by multiplying the number of employees (30) by the hourly rate ($15) and the number of hours worked (40).
5. Add the total amount paid in May ($24,000) to the total amount paid in June ($18,000) to get the overall total amount paid to the employees in the two months ($24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000).

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total distance run by Blake by multiplying 100 yards by 15 times.
2. Calculate the total distance run by Kelly by adding the distance of each round trip (80 yards) to the 40-yard line.
3. Find the difference between the total distances run by Blake and Kelly to determine how much farther the winner ran than the loser.

Answer:
Blake ran a total of 1500 yards (100 yards x 15 times).
Kelly ran a total of 2720 yards (80 yards x 34 times + 40 yards x 34 times).
The difference is 1220 yards.
The answer is 1220.

Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have after gaining 5 pairs on Monday, 15 pairs on Wednesday, and 30 pairs on Friday.
Total shoes = 200 + (5*2) + (15*2) + (30*2) = 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300
2. Subtract 180 shoes, which he gets rid of on Saturday.
Total shoes on Sunday = 300 - 180 = 120

Ground Truth: Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.
#### 1920
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find out how much potting soil Bob needs to fill all 10 raised beds, first calculate the volume of one raised bed (2 feet wide x 8 feet long x 2 feet tall = 32 cubic feet). Then, multiply the volume of one raised bed by the total number of beds (32 cubic feet x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet). Finally, divide the total volume needed by the volume of one bag of potting soil (320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags needed). Multiply the number of bags needed by the cost per bag to find the total cost.
