Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To answer this question, I will first determine how many days it takes for one person to paint a whole house by doubling the time it takes for one person to paint half a house. Then, I will convert the number of days to hours since the question asks for the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Finally, I will divide the total number of hours by 5 to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

Answer:
It takes 10 days for one person to paint a whole house, which is equivalent to 240 hours. Therefore, it would take 48 hours for 5 people to paint a whole house. The answer is 48.

Task 409: 0.40
Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000

Task 157: 0.30
Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total distance each person ran.
2. Subtract the total distance run by the loser from the total distance run by the winner to find the difference in distance. 

Answer:
Blake ran a total of 3000 yards (100 yards x 2 x 15 times).
Kelly ran a total of 1360 yards (40 yards x 2 x 34 times).

3000 - 1360 = 1640

The answer is 1640.

Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank gains throughout the week by adding up the number of pairs he gets each day. 
2. Subtract the number of shoes he gets rid of on Saturday from the total gained throughout the week to find out how many shoes he has left. 
3. The final result will be the total number of shoes he has left after the calculation.

Answer:
Total number of shoes gained throughout the week = 5 pairs on Monday + 15 pairs on Wednesday + 30 pairs on Friday = 50 pairs
Total number of shoes Fireman Frank has after gaining shoes = 200 shoes + 50 pairs = 300 shoes
Number of shoes he gets rid of on Saturday = 180 shoes
Number of shoes he has left = 300 shoes - 180 shoes = 120

The answer is 120

Ground Truth: A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning you will save 20/100*$400=$<<20/100*400=80>>80 if you make your own hand-painted wallpaper.
The total cost of a hand-painted wallpaper made at home is $400-$80 = $<<400-80=320>>320
#### 320
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find the total cost of Ethan's DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we will first calculate the 20% saving from the market price of $400. Then, we will subtract this saving from the market price to determine the total cost of materials for Ethan. Finally, the total cost will be the sum of the materials cost and the savings.
Answer:
Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = $400 - $80 = $320
Total cost = Materials cost + Savings = $320 + $80 = $400

Cookie Monster’s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.
Summer’s total cookie amount is 73+23 = <<73+23=96>>96.
Total amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.
#### 298
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Let K be the number of cookies Katarina has, M be the number of cookies Max has, C be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has, and S be the number of cookies Summer has. We can create the following system of equations:
K = M - 5
M = C + 12
S = M + 23
K = 68
2. Substitute the values from the equations into each other to find the number of cookies each person has:
68 = M - 5
M = 68 + 5
M = 73

73 = C + 12
C = 73 - 12
C = 61

S = 73 + 23
S = 96
3. Add up the number of cookies each person has:
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298
