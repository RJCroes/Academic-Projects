Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples â€“ 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Let x be the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.
2. From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
- Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, x/2 apples from the shortest trees, and x apples from the average trees.
- Her sister gathered 2(30) = 60 apples from the tallest trees and 3(x/2) = 3x/2 apples from the shortest trees.
- The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 30 + x + 60 + 3x/2 = 500.
3. Solve the equations to find the value of x, which represents the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

Ground Truth: Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes
Warm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes
3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes
3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes
Ray takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer
#### 54
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To answer this question, I will first calculate how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a warm day. Then, I will determine how long it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day. Finally, I will find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day to determine how much longer Ray takes on a hot day.

Answer:
Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long, which is 2(16) + 2 = 34 minutes. Therefore, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile on a hot day. 
To swim 3 miles on a cold day, Ray takes 16 * 3 = 48 minutes. 
To swim 3 miles on a hot day, Ray takes 34 * 3 = 102 minutes. 
The difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes. 
The answer is 54.

Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May by multiplying the number of employees hired (40) by their hourly wage ($15) and the number of hours worked (40).
2. Calculate the total amount paid to employees in June by first finding 1/4 of the total number of employees hired in May (40) whose contracts expired (10). Then, subtract this number from the total number of employees in May to find the remaining employees (30). Finally, multiply the remaining employees by their hourly wage ($15) and the number of hours worked (40).
3. Add the total amounts paid to employees in May and June to find the overall total amount paid to the employees in the two months.

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran and then compare the two totals. We will first calculate the total distance Blake ran by multiplying the number of times he ran back and forth (15 times) by the length of the football field (100 yards). Then, we will calculate the total distance Kelly ran by multiplying the number of times she ran to the 40-yard line and back (34 times) by 80 yards (since she only ran a portion of the field each time). Finally, we will subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance to find out how much farther the winner ran.

Answer:
The answer is 600 yards.

Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Start with 200 shoes.
2. After Monday, he will have 200 + 5 pairs = 210 pairs.
3. After Wednesday, he will have 210 + 15 pairs = 225 pairs.
4. After Friday, he will have 225 + 30 pairs = 255 pairs.
5. After Saturday, he will have 255 - 180 pairs = 75 pairs.
6. Calculate the total number of shoes he will have on Sunday by converting pairs to individual shoes: 75 pairs * 2 = 150 shoes.

Ground Truth: Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.
#### 1920
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed by multiplying the width, length, and height: 2 ft x 8 ft x 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.
2. Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds by multiplying the volume of soil needed for one bed by 10: 32 cubic feet x 10 = 320 cubic feet.
3. Divide the total volume of soil needed by the volume of soil in each bag to determine how many bags are required: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags.
4. Multiply the number of bags needed by the cost per bag to find the total cost of the potting soil for all 10 raised beds: 160 bags x $12 per bag = $1920.

Ground Truth: A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning you will save 20/100*$400=$<<20/100*400=80>>80 if you make your own hand-painted wallpaper.
The total cost of a hand-painted wallpaper made at home is $400-$80 = $<<400-80=320>>320
#### 320
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find the total cost of Ethan's DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we will first calculate the amount saved by the DIY method (20% of $400). Then, we will subtract this saved amount from the original cost to find the total cost incurred by Ethan.

Answer:
Amount saved = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Total cost = $400 - $80 = $320
