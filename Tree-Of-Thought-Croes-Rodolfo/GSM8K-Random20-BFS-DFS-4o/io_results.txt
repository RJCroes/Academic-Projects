Ground Truth: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
Generated Solution: To determine how much Cynthia spends on ice cream after 60 days, we first need to calculate how many servings of ice cream she consumes in that period.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream per day:
Number of servings in 60 days = 60 servings

Each carton contains 15 servings:
Number of cartons needed = 60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Each carton costs $4.00:
Total cost = 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Ground Truth: Kira bought 3 + 5 + 6 = <<3+5+6=14>>14 pieces of fruit.
After Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit there are 14 - 2 = <<14-2=12>>12 pieces of fruit.
#### 12
Generated Solution: Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. To find the total number of pieces of fruit Kira bought, we add these numbers together:

3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. Therefore, we subtract the number of pieces Lola ate from the total number of pieces Kira bought:

14 pieces of fruit - 2 pieces of fruit = 12 pieces of fruit

The answer is 12

Task 135: 1.00
Ground Truth: If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.
#### 40
Generated Solution: First, we need to determine the number of video games Brian has at the time of the comparison. According to the problem, Brian originally has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made. Therefore, the number of video games Brian has at the time of the comparison is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Next, we need to calculate how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. Thus, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of Bobby's video games} = 3 \times \text{Number of Brian's video games} - 5 \]

Substituting the number of Brian's video games into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of Bobby's video games} = 3 \times 15 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation:

\[ \text{Number of Bobby's video games} = 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Task 1203: 1.00
Ground Truth: Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.
#### 240
Generated Solution: To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of Mattison's house:
   \[
   \text{Height of Mattison's house} = 7 \times \text{Height of Mattison} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Determine the height of the first floor from floor to ceiling:
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Height of Mattison} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the combined height of the second floor and the space from the second floor's floor to the roof:
   \[
   \text{Height of the second floor and roof space} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.

The answer is 240

Task 527: 1.00
Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: First, let's determine how long it takes for one person to paint the entire house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take the same person 10 days to paint the whole house.

Next, we convert this duration into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, one person would take:
10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours to paint the whole house.

Now, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint the whole house. If 5 people are working together, the work they do is 5 times as fast as one person working alone. Therefore, it would take them:
240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours to paint the whole house.

Task 596: 1.00
Ground Truth: The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.
#### 260
Generated Solution: To calculate how many hours George needs to work, we first need to determine the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base cost for 2 implants is:
\[ 2 \text{ implants} \times \$2000 \text{ per implant} = \$4000 \]

2. The additional cost for the porcelain crown is:
\[ \$500 \]

3. Adding the base cost and the additional cost for the porcelain crown gives us:
\[ \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \]

4. George has already put down a deposit of:
\[ \$600 \]

5. The remaining amount George needs to pay is:
\[ \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \]

6. George makes \$15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \$3900, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Hourly wage}} = \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} \]

7. Calculating this gives:
\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15} = 260 \]

Task 415: 1.00
Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples â€“ 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of apples Joanne and her sister gather from each type of tree. We will use the following variables:
- \( A \) for the apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
- \( T \) for the apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees, which is given as 30.
- \( S \) for the apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees, which is half of 30, so \( S = 15 \).

Joanne's sister gathers:
- \( 2T \) apples from the tallest trees.
- \( 3S \) apples from the shortest trees.
- 0 apples from the average trees.

Given that together they gather a total of 500 apples, we can write the equation for the total number of apples gathered:
\[ T + S + A + 2T + 3S = 500 \]

Substituting the values of \( T \) and \( S \) into the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

Ground Truth: Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes
Warm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes
3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes
3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes
Ray takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer
#### 54
Generated Solution: Let's first determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. The problem states that when the water is warm, Ray takes 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water.

1. Time to swim a mile in cold water: 16 minutes
2. Time to swim a mile in warm water: 2 * 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

1. Time to swim 3 miles in cold water: 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
2. Time to swim 3 miles in warm water: 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

Finally, we find the difference between the two times:

102 minutes (warm water) - 48 minutes (cold water) = 54 minutes

Task 409: 1.00
Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: First, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May.

In May:
- Number of employees: 40
- Pay per hour: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in May: 4

Total pay per employee in May:
\[ 15 \text{ (dollars per hour)} \times 40 \text{ (hours per week)} \times 4 \text{ (weeks)} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Total pay for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \text{ (dollars per employee)} \times 40 \text{ (employees)} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

In June:
- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees remaining:
\[ 40 \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 40 \times \frac{3}{4} = 30 \]

Total pay per employee in June:
\[ 15 \text{ (dollars per hour)} \times 40 \text{ (hours per week)} \times 4 \text{ (weeks)} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Total pay for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \text{ (dollars per employee)} \times 30 \text{ (employees)} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Total amount paid by the company in the two months:
\[ 96000 \text{ (dollars in May)} + 72000 \text{ (dollars in June)} = 168000 \]

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: To solve the problem, we first need to calculate the total distance each person runs.

1. **Blake's Distance:**
   - Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field.
   - Each complete back and forth is 2 lengths of the field (100 yards each way).
   - Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
     \[
     15 \times (100 \text{ yards} \times 2) = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Kelly's Distance:**
   - Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard football field.
   - Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
   - The initial back and forth on the 100-yard field:
     \[
     100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - Each run to the 40-yard line and back is 40 yards each way, so 80 yards per round trip.
   - For 34 round trips:
     \[
     34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - Adding the initial 200 yards:
     \[
     200 \text{ yards} + 2720 \text{ yards} = 2920 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Difference in Distance:**
   - Blake's total distance is 3000 yards.
   - Kelly's total distance is 2920 yards.
   - The difference between Blake's and Kelly's distances:
     \[
     3000 \text{ yards} - 2920 \text{ yards} = 80 \text{ yards}
     \]

Thus, Blake runs farther than Kelly by 80 yards.

Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes:
5 pairs * 2 shoes per pair = 10 shoes
200 shoes + 10 shoes = 210 shoes

On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes:
15 pairs * 2 shoes per pair = 30 shoes
210 shoes + 30 shoes = 240 shoes

On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes:
30 pairs * 2 shoes per pair = 60 shoes
240 shoes + 60 shoes = 300 shoes

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes:
300 shoes - 180 shoes = 120 shoes

The answer is 120.

So they take 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 minutes together
The last 2 sides take 5/2=<<5/2=2.5>>2.5 minutes
So they take 2.5*2=<<2.5*2=5>>5 minutes
So the total time is 5+20+5=<<5+20+5=30>>30 minutes
#### 30
Generated Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube by summing up the time taken for each side.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side:
   - Time for the second side = 2 * 5 = 10 minutes
   - Time for the third side = 2 * 5 = 10 minutes
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side:
   - Time for the fourth side = 0.5 * 5 = 2.5 minutes
   - Time for the fifth side = 0.5 * 5 = 2.5 minutes

Once the fifth side is completed, all six sides are solved.

Now, let's add up all the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Ground Truth: Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.
#### 1920
Generated Solution: First, calculate the volume of one raised bed:
Volume of one bed = length Ã— width Ã— height
Volume of one bed = 8 feet Ã— 2 feet Ã— 2 feet
Volume of one bed = 32 cubic feet

Next, calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds:
Total volume = volume of one bed Ã— number of beds
Total volume = 32 cubic feet Ã— 10
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Now, calculate the number of bags of potting soil needed:
Number of bags = total volume / volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag
Number of bags = 160 bags

Finally, calculate the total cost:
Total cost = number of bags Ã— cost per bag
Total cost = 160 bags Ã— $12 per bag
Total cost = $1920

Calculate the savings:
\[ \text{Savings} = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

Subtract the savings from the market cost to find the total cost for Ethan:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Answer:
Ethan's total cost for making his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320. The answer is 320

Ground Truth: Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.
#### 8
Generated Solution: To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, let's denote the number of chocolate bars per box as \( x \).

Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, which is \( 3.5x \).

Peter sold four and a half boxes of chocolate bars, which is \( 4.5x \).

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

The answer is 8.

Ground Truth: Mariahâ€™s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.
#### 273
Generated Solution: To determine how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount each used and then add them together.

First, let's calculate how many yards Mariah used:
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein.
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how many yards her grandma used:
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein.
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, add the two amounts together to find the total yards used:

Then add the number of each kind of leg to find the total he saw: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs
#### 1210
Generated Solution: To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and then sum these values.

First, calculate the number of legs for the spiders:
80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs

Next, calculate the number of legs for the insects:
90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs

Then, calculate the number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates:
3 rare mutant invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs

Now, sum the legs of all the creatures:
640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (rare mutant invertebrates) = 1210 legs

The answer is 1210

Ground Truth: Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel who went down 30 times so that's .30*30 = <<30*.01*30=9>>9 times less
Mitchel went down 30 times and Anne went down 9 times less than him for a total of 30-9 = <<30-9=21>>21 times
Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, who went down 21 times so Robert went down the slide 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 times
#### 84
Generated Solution: First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

Mitchel's slides: 30
30% of 30 slides = 0.30 * 30 = 9 slides
Anne's slides = 30 - 9 = 21 slides

Next, we need to calculate how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:

Robert's slides = 4 * Anne's slides = 4 * 21 = 84 slides

The answer is 84

Ground Truth: Maxâ€™s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.
Cookie Monsterâ€™s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.
Summerâ€™s total cookie amount is 73+23 = <<73+23=96>>96.
Total amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.
#### 298
Generated Solution: To determine the total number of cookies they all have, let's first define the variables based on the information given:

1. Let \( K \) represent the number of cookies Katarina has.
2. Let \( M \) represent the number of cookies Max has.
3. Let \( C \) represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
4. Let \( S \) represent the number of cookies Summer has.

We know the following relationships:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \)
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \)
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \)
- Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \)

First, we can use Katarina's given cookies to find Max's cookies:
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we use Max's cookies to find the Cookie Monster's cookies:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Then, we use Max's cookies to find Summer's cookies:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we add up all the cookies:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Calculate the total:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Ground Truth: First find the number of pillow cases in each room: 2 sheets * 2 pillow cases/sheet = <<2*2=4>>4 pillow cases
Then find the number of towels in each room: 4 pillow cases * 2 towels/pillow case = <<4*2=8>>8 towels
Then find the number of pieces of laundry in each room: 4 pillow cases + 8 towels + 2 sheets + 1 comforter = <<4+8+2+1=15>>15 pieces of laundry
Then multiply the number of pieces of laundry in each room by the number of rooms to find the total: 15 pieces of laundry/room * 80 rooms = <<15*80=1200>>1200 pieces
#### 1200
Generated Solution: To determine how many pieces of laundry there are in 80 rooms, we need to first calculate the number of each type of item per room and then sum them up.

1. **Sheets per room**: 2 sheets
2. **Comforters per room**: 1 comforter
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Twice as many as sheets, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases
4. **Towels per room**: Twice as many as pillow cases, which is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels

Now, we sum up the laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total pieces of laundry per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

Finally, we multiply the total pieces of laundry per room by the number of rooms:
Total pieces of laundry for 80 rooms = 15 pieces/room \(\times\) 80 rooms = 1200 pieces

The answer is 1200
