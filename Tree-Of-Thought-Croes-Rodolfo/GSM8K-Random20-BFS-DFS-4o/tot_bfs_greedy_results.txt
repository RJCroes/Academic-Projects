Ground Truth: Kira bought 3 + 5 + 6 = <<3+5+6=14>>14 pieces of fruit.
After Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit there are 14 - 2 = <<14-2=12>>12 pieces of fruit.
#### 12
Generated Solution: Strategy:
First, determine the total number of pieces of fruit that Kira originally bought by adding the quantities of apples, bananas, and oranges together. Then, subtract the number of pieces of fruit that Lola ate from this total to find out how many pieces are left.

Answer:
Kira originally bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. Adding these together gives:
3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit.
Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, so subtracting this from the total gives:
14 - 2 = 12 pieces of fruit left.
The answer is 12

Ground Truth: Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.
#### 240
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total height of the two-story house by multiplying Mattison's height by 7.
2. Determine the height from the floor to the ceiling on the first floor by multiplying Mattison's height by 3.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the combined height of the ceiling of the first floor and the height of the second floor.
4. From the result in step 3, subtract Mattison's height (the distance from the floor to the ceiling on the second floor) to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

Answer:
1. Total height of the house = 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.
2. Height from floor to ceiling on the first floor = 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.
3. Combined height of the ceiling of the first floor and the height of the second floor = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.
4. Height of the roof from the second floor's floor = 240 inches - 60 inches = 180 inches.

The answer is 180.

Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the rate at which one person can paint a house.
2. Calculate the combined rate for 5 people working together.
3. Use the combined rate to determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house.
4. Convert the time from days to hours.

Answer:
1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then one person can paint a whole house in \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) days. Therefore, the rate at which one person can paint a house is \( \frac{1}{10} \) house per day.
2. The combined rate for 5 people working together is \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) house per day.
3. To paint a whole house at the rate of \( \frac{1}{2} \) house per day, it would take \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \) days.
4. Convert 2 days to hours: \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) hours.

Ground Truth: The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.
#### 260
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost for the dental work by adding the base prices of the two implants and the additional cost for the porcelain crown.
2. Subtract the deposit George has already put down from the total cost.
3. Determine the remaining amount that George needs to pay.
4. Calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount by dividing the remaining cost by his hourly wage.
5. Round up to the nearest whole number, since George can only work whole hours.

Answer:
1. Total cost = (2 implants * $2000) + $500 for porcelain crown = $4000 + $500 = $4500.
2. Remaining amount after deposit = $4500 - $600 = $3900.
3. George needs to earn $3900.
4. Hours needed to work = $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.
5. Since George can only work whole hours, no rounding is necessary.

The answer is 260.

Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples â€“ 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. Define variables:
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

2. Calculate the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees:
   - Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
   - Joanne gathers half of 30 (which is 15) from the shortest trees.

3. Calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers:
   - Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees (2 * 30 = 60).
   - Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees (3 * 15 = 45).

4. Express the total number of apples gathered by both sisters in terms of \( A \):
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 \) (tallest) + \( 15 \) (shortest) + \( A \) (average)
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne's sister: \( 60 \) (tallest) + \( 45 \) (shortest)

5. Set up the equation to represent the combined total of 500 apples:
   - \( (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45) = 500 \)

6. Solve for \( A \):
   - \( 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \)
   - \( 150 + A = 500 \)
   - \( A = 500 - 150 \)
   - \( A = 350 \)

Task 409: 1.00
Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees in May.
2. Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May by multiplying the total hours worked by the hourly wage.
3. Determine the number of employees whose contracts expired in June.
4. Calculate the number of employees still working in June.
5. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the remaining employees in June.
6. Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June by multiplying the total hours worked by the hourly wage.
7. Add the total amounts paid in May and June to find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees over the two months.

Answer:
1. Total number of hours worked by all employees in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 6,400 hours
2. Total amount of money paid to employees in May = 6,400 hours * $15/hour = $96,000
3. Number of employees whose contracts expired in June = 1/4 * 40 employees = 10 employees
4. Number of employees still working in June = 40 employees - 10 employees = 30 employees
5. Total number of hours worked by the remaining employees in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 4,800 hours
6. Total amount of money paid to employees in June = 4,800 hours * $15/hour = $72,000
7. Total amount of money the company paid to the employees over the two months = $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. Determine the total distance Blake runs.
   - Calculate the distance for one complete back-and-forth trip on the 100-yard field: 100 yards there and 100 yards back, totaling 200 yards.
   - Multiply the distance of one trip by the number of trips Blake makes: 200 yards/trip * 15 trips = 3000 yards.

2. Determine the total distance Kelly runs.
   - Calculate the distance for one complete back-and-forth trip on the 100-yard field that she does initially: 100 yards there and 100 yards back, totaling 200 yards.
   - Calculate the distance for one complete back-and-forth trip to the 40-yard line: 40 yards there and 40 yards back, totaling 80 yards.
   - Multiply the distance of the 40-yard trip by the number of trips Kelly makes: 80 yards/trip * 34 trips = 2720 yards.
   - Add the distance from the initial 100-yard back-and-forth trip to the total distance of the 40-yard trips: 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

3. Compare the total distances run by Blake and Kelly.
   - Subtract the lesser distance from the greater distance to find how much farther the winner runs than the loser: 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards.

The answer is 80.

Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: ### Strategy:
1. **Convert Pairs to Individual Shoes**: Since the shoe counts are given in pairs, I will first convert these pair counts to individual shoe counts (1 pair = 2 shoes).
2. **Calculate the Total Shoes Gained**: Add the individual shoes gained on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
3. **Determine the Total Shoes Before Saturday**: Add the total shoes gained during the week to the initial number of shoes.
4. **Subtract the Shoes Disposed of on Saturday**: Subtract the 180 shoes that were disposed of on Saturday from the total calculated in the previous step.
5. **Find the Final Count on Sunday**: The result after the subtraction will be the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday.

### Calculation:
1. Convert pairs to individual shoes:
   - Monday: 5 pairs = 5 * 2 = 10 shoes
   - Wednesday: 15 pairs = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes
   - Friday: 30 pairs = 30 * 2 = 60 shoes

2. Calculate the total shoes gained:
   - Total shoes gained = 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 100 shoes

3. Determine the total shoes before Saturday:
   - Initial shoes = 200
   - Total shoes before Saturday = 200 + 100 = 300 shoes

4. Subtract the shoes disposed of on Saturday:
   - Total shoes after Saturday = 300 - 180 = 120 shoes

Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.
#### 273
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, follow these steps:
1. Determine how many yards are in 1/4 of a skein of yarn by multiplying 1/4 by 364 yards.
2. Determine how many yards are in 1/2 of a skein of yarn by multiplying 1/2 by 364 yards.
3. Add the two results together to find the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether.

Answer:
1. \( \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \) yards
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \) yards
3. \( 91 + 182 = 273 \)

The answer is 273

Ground Truth: First find the total number of spider legs: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = <<80*8=640>>640 legs
Then find the total number of insect legs: 90 spiders * 6 legs/spider = <<90*6=540>>540 legs
Then find the total number of mutant invertebrate legs: 3 mutants * 10 legs/mutant = <<3*10=30>>30 legs
Then add the number of each kind of leg to find the total he saw: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs
#### 1210
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, I will use the following steps:
1. Calculate the total number of legs for the spiders by multiplying the number of spiders (80) by the number of legs each spider has (8).
2. Calculate the total number of legs for the insects by multiplying the number of insects (90) by the number of legs each insect has (6).
3. Calculate the total number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates by multiplying the number of mutants (3) by the number of legs each mutant has (10).
4. Sum the results from steps 1, 2, and 3 to find the total number of legs Jake sees.

Answer:
1. Total legs for spiders = 80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs
2. Total legs for insects = 90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs
3. Total legs for rare mutant invertebrates = 3 mutants * 10 legs each = 30 legs
4. Total number of legs = 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs

The answer is 1210

Task 254: 1.00
Ground Truth: Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel who went down 30 times so that's .30*30 = <<30*.01*30=9>>9 times less
Mitchel went down 30 times and Anne went down 9 times less than him for a total of 30-9 = <<30-9=21>>21 times
Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, who went down 21 times so Robert went down the slide 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 times
#### 84
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Identify the number of times Mitchel went down the water slide (30 times).
2. Calculate the number of times Anne went down the water slide by determining 30% less than Mitchel's total.
3. Calculate the number of times Robert went down the water slide by multiplying Anne's total by 4.
4. Verify each step to ensure the calculations are correct and find the final number of times Robert went down the water slide.

Answer:
1. Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
2. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which is 30 - (30 * 0.30) = 30 - 9 = 21 times.
3. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, which is 21 * 4 = 84 times.

Task 681: 1.00
Ground Truth: Maxâ€™s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.
Cookie Monsterâ€™s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.
Summerâ€™s total cookie amount is 73+23 = <<73+23=96>>96.
Total amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.
#### 298
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. **Identify and Define Variables:**
   - Let \( K \) represent the number of cookies Katarina has.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of cookies Max has.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of cookies Summer has.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Problem Statement:**
   - Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \).
   - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \).
   - Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \).

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( K = 68 \).
   - Substitute \( K = 68 \) into the equation \( K = M - 5 \):
     \[
     68 = M - 5
     \]
     Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 68 + 5 = 73
     \]
   - Use \( M = 73 \) to find \( C \) using \( M = C + 12 \):
     \[
     73 = C + 12
     \]
     Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 73 - 12 = 61
     \]
   - Use \( M = 73 \) to find \( S \) using \( S = M + 23 \):
     \[
     S = 73 + 23 = 96
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Cookies:**
   - Sum the number of cookies each person has:
     \[
     K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
     \]
     \[
     68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298
     \]

The answer is 298.
