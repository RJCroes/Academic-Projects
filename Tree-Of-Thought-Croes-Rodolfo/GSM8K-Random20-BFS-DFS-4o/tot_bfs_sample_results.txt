Ground Truth: If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.
#### 40
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Identify the total number of video games Brian originally had before losing any games.
2. Apply the information given about the loss to find Brian's current number of video games.
3. Set up the relationship between the number of video games Bobby has and the current number Brian has, as described in the problem.
4. Calculate the number of video games Bobby has using the given relationship and the current number of video games Brian has.

Answer:
1. Brian originally had 20 video games.
2. After losing 5 video games, Brian has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.
3. Bobby has 3 times as many video games as Brian does, minus 5. This relationship can be written as: Bobby's games = 3 * (Brian's current games) - 5.
4. Substituting Brian's current number of video games into the equation, we get: Bobby's games = 3 * 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40.

The answer is 40.

Task 527: 1.00
Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: ### Strategy:
1. **Determine the painting rate of one person**: Calculate the rate at which one person can paint by determining how much of the house they can paint per day.
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint \( \frac{1}{2} \) house in 5 days.
   - The painting rate of one person is \( \frac{1}{2} \) house / 5 days = \( \frac{1}{10} \) house per day.
2. **Calculate the collective painting rate for multiple people**: Multiply the individual painting rate by the number of people to find the combined rate.
   - The collective painting rate for 5 people is \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} \) house per day = \( \frac{5}{10} \) house per day = \( \frac{1}{2} \) house per day.
3. **Calculate the total time required**: Determine the total amount of time needed for the group to paint the entire house based on their combined rate.
   - Since 5 people can paint \( \frac{1}{2} \) house per day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days.
4. **Convert days to hours**: Convert the total time from days to hours, as the final answer needs to be in hours.
   - 2 days = 2 days × 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

The answer is 48.

Task 596: 1.00
Ground Truth: The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.
#### 260
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work by adding the base price of both implants and the additional cost of the porcelain crown.
2. Subtract the deposit George has already made from the total cost to determine the remaining amount he needs to pay.
3. Determine George's hourly wage and use it to calculate the total number of hours he needs to work to cover the remaining amount.
4. Ensure the calculated hours are rounded up if necessary, as George cannot work a fraction of an hour.

Answer:
1. Total cost of the dental work:
   - Base price for 2 implants: 2 * $2000 = $4000
   - Additional cost for porcelain crown: $500
   - Total cost: $4000 + $500 = $4500

2. Remaining amount after deposit:
   - Total cost: $4500
   - Deposit: $600
   - Remaining amount: $4500 - $600 = $3900

3. Hours needed to work:
   - George's hourly wage: $15 per hour
   - Hours needed: $3900 / $15 = 260

4. Since George cannot work a fraction of an hour, no rounding is necessary in this case.

Task 415: 1.00
Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

2. **Identify Known Values:**
   - Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
   - Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
   - Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Write an equation representing the total number of apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + A \).
   - Write an equation representing the total number of apples gathered by her sister: \( 60 + 45 \).

4. **Combine and Solve:**
   - Combine the equations to represent the total apples gathered by both sisters: 
     \( (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45) = 500 \).
   - Simplify and solve for \( A \):
     \[
     30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500
     \]
     \[
     150 + A = 500
     \]
     \[
     A = 500 - 150
     \]
     \[
     A = 350
     \]

5. **Verify Solution:**
   - Ensure the calculated number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees fits the total of 500 apples when combined with the other values.
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + 350 = 395 \)
   - Her sister's total: \( 60 + 45 = 105 \)
   - Combined total: \( 395 + 105 = 500 \), which fits the given total.

Ray takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer
#### 54
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. **Determine Ray's swimming time in cold water:**
   - Identify the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in cold water (given as 16 minutes).

2. **Calculate Ray's swimming time in warm water:**
   - Use the given relationship to find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water (2 minutes more than twice the time in cold water).

3. **Find the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:**
   - Multiply the time per mile by 3 to get the total time for swimming 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

4. **Compare the total times:**
   - Subtract the total time for swimming 3 miles in cold water from the total time for swimming 3 miles in warm water.

5. **Conclude the difference:**
   - State the additional time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water.

**Answer:**

1. Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water.

2. In warm water, the time it takes Ray to swim a mile is 2 minutes more than twice the time in cold water:
   - Twice the time in cold water: 2 * 16 = 32 minutes
   - Add 2 minutes: 32 + 2 = 34 minutes
   - Therefore, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes in warm water.

3. Total time for 3 miles in both conditions:
   - Cold water: 3 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 48 minutes
   - Warm water: 3 miles * 34 minutes/mile = 102 minutes

4. Compare the total times:
   - Difference: 102 minutes (warm water) - 48 minutes (cold water) = 54 minutes

Task 409: 1.00
Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the total number of hours worked by each employee per month.
2. Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees in May.
3. Calculate the total wages paid to all employees in May.
4. Determine the number of employees whose contracts expired in June.
5. Calculate the number of employees still working in June after the contracts expired.
6. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the remaining employees in June.
7. Calculate the total wages paid to the remaining employees in June.
8. Sum the total wages paid in May and June to get the overall total amount paid by the company.

Answer:
1. Each employee works 40 hours per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, so each employee works 40 * 4 = 160 hours per month.
2. In May, the total number of hours worked by all 40 employees is 40 * 160 = 6400 hours.
3. The total wages paid to all employees in May is 6400 hours * $15 per hour = $96,000.
4. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 40 * 1/4 = 10 employees' contracts expired.
5. The number of employees still working in June is 40 - 10 = 30 employees.
6. The total number of hours worked by the remaining 30 employees in June is 30 * 160 = 4800 hours.
7. The total wages paid to the remaining employees in June is 4800 hours * $15 per hour = $72,000.
8. The overall total amount paid by the company is $96,000 (May) + $72,000 (June) = $168,000.

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. **Calculate Blake's Total Distance:**
   - Determine the distance of one complete back-and-forth run on the football field (i.e., 200 yards per round trip).
   - Multiply the distance of one round trip by the number of trips Blake completes (15 times).

2. **Calculate Kelly's Total Distance:**
   - Calculate the distance of one complete back-and-forth run on the football field (i.e., 200 yards per initial round trip).
   - Determine the distance of one round trip to the 40-yard line (i.e., 80 yards per round trip).
   - Multiply the distance of the 40-yard line round trip by the number of times Kelly completes this trip (34 times).
   - Add the initial round trip distance to the sum of the 40-yard line round trips.

3. **Compare the Distances:**
   - Subtract the shorter total distance from the longer total distance to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser.

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate Blake's Total Distance:**
   - One round trip on the football field: 100 yards there + 100 yards back = 200 yards.
   - Blake's total distance: 200 yards/trip × 15 trips = 3000 yards.

2. **Calculate Kelly's Total Distance:**
   - Initial round trip: 200 yards.
   - Distance of one 40-yard line round trip: 40 yards there + 40 yards back = 80 yards.
   - Distance for 34 trips to the 40-yard line and back: 80 yards/trip × 34 trips = 2720 yards.
   - Kelly's total distance: 200 yards (initial round trip) + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

3. **Compare the Distances:**
   - Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
   - Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards.
   - Difference: 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards.

Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Begin by noting the initial number of shoes Fireman Frank has.
2. Calculate the total number of shoes added during the week by converting the number of pairs of shoes he receives on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday into individual shoes and summing them up.
3. Add the total number of shoes gained during the week to the initial number of shoes to get the subtotal before Saturday.
4. Subtract the number of shoes Fireman Frank gets rid of on Saturday from the subtotal to find the final number of shoes he has on Sunday.
5. Ensure all calculations are done correctly to determine the accurate final count of shoes on Sunday.

Answer:
1. Initial number of shoes: 200
2. Shoes gained during the week:
   - Monday: 5 pairs = 5 * 2 = 10 shoes
   - Wednesday: 15 pairs = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes
   - Friday: 30 pairs = 30 * 2 = 60 shoes
   Total shoes gained = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes
3. Subtotal before Saturday: 200 + 100 = 300 shoes
4. Shoes gotten rid of on Saturday: 180
5. Final number of shoes on Sunday: 300 - 180 = 120

Ground Truth: Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.
#### 1920
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. **Calculate the Volume of One Raised Bed:** Determine the volume of a single raised bed by multiplying its dimensions (length, width, and height).

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

2. **Calculate the Total Volume for All Raised Beds:** Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the total number of raised beds to find the total volume of potting soil needed.

\[ \text{Total volume for all raised beds} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

3. **Determine the Number of Bags Required:** Divide the total volume of potting soil needed by the volume of soil that one bag holds to find out the total number of bags required.

\[ \text{Number of bags required} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

4. **Calculate the Total Cost:** Multiply the number of bags required by the cost per bag to get the total cost of the potting soil.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Ground Truth: Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.
#### 8
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. **Define Variables:** Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in a single box.
2. **Express Quantities Sold:** Express the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter in terms of \( x \). 
   - Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, which is \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
   - Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.
3. **Set Up Equation:** Add the quantities sold by Lisa and Peter and set this sum equal to the total number of chocolate bars sold, which is 64. This forms the equation \( 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \).
4. **Solve for \( x \):** Simplify and solve the equation to find the value of \( x \), which represents the number of chocolate bars in a box.
   \[
   3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \\
   8x = 64 \\
   x = 8
   \]
5. **Verify:** Double-check the solution to ensure that it satisfies the original conditions of the problem.
   - Lisa's total: \( 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \)
   - Peter's total: \( 4.5 \times 8 = 36 \)
   - Combined total: \( 28 + 36 = 64 \), which matches the given total.

Ground Truth: Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.
#### 273
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**
To determine the total yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used by multiplying 1/4 of a skein by the total yards in a skein (364 yards).
2. Calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used by multiplying 1/2 of a skein by the total yards in a skein (364 yards).
3. Add the two results together to find the total amount of yarn used by both Mariah and her grandma.

This strategy ensures that we account for the different portions of the skein each person used and then combine those amounts to get the total yards used.

**Answer:**
1. Mariah used: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \) yards
2. Mariah's grandma used: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \) yards
3. Total yards used: \( 91 + 182 = 273 \)

Then find the total number of mutant invertebrate legs: 3 mutants * 10 legs/mutant = <<3*10=30>>30 legs
Then add the number of each kind of leg to find the total he saw: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs
#### 1210
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To determine the total number of legs Jake sees in the Museum of Entomology, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs contributed by the spiders by multiplying the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has.
2. Calculate the total number of legs contributed by the insects by multiplying the number of insects by the number of legs each insect has.
3. Calculate the total number of legs contributed by the rare mutant invertebrates by multiplying the number of these invertebrates by the number of legs each one has.
4. Sum the results from the above three steps to obtain the total number of legs Jake sees.

Answer:
1. For the spiders: \( 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \)
2. For the insects: \( 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \)
3. For the rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \)

Ground Truth: Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel who went down 30 times so that's .30*30 = <<30*.01*30=9>>9 times less
Mitchel went down 30 times and Anne went down 9 times less than him for a total of 30-9 = <<30-9=21>>21 times
Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, who went down 21 times so Robert went down the slide 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 times
#### 84
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the number of times Anne went down the slide by calculating 30% less than the number of times Mitchel went down.
2. Convert the percentage reduction to a numerical value and subtract it from Mitchel's total.
3. Calculate the number of times Robert went down the slide by multiplying the number of times Anne went down by 4.

Answer:
1. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
2. 30% of 30 is \( 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \).
3. Anne went down the slide \( 30 - 9 = 21 \) times.
4. Robert went down the slide \( 21 \times 4 = 84 \) times.
