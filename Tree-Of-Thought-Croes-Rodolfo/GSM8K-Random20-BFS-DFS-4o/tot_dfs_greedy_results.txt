Ground Truth: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. **Determine Total Servings Needed:** Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume over 60 days.
   
2. **Calculate Number of Cartons Required:** Divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton to find out how many cartons Cynthia needs to buy.

3. **Determine Total Cost:** Multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream over 60 days.

**Answer:**

1. Total servings needed: \( 60 \) days \(\times 1\) serving/day = \( 60 \) servings.
   
2. Number of cartons required: \( 60 \) servings \(\div 15\) servings/carton = \( 4 \) cartons.
   
3. Total cost: \( 4 \) cartons \(\times \$4.00\)/carton = \$16.00.

The answer is 16.

Ground Truth: Kira bought 3 + 5 + 6 = <<3+5+6=14>>14 pieces of fruit.
After Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit there are 14 - 2 = <<14-2=12>>12 pieces of fruit.
#### 12
Generated Solution: Strategy:
First, determine the total number of pieces of fruit Kira initially bought by summing the quantities of apples, bananas, and oranges. Then, subtract the number of pieces of fruit that Lola ate from this total to find out how many pieces are left.

Answer:
Kira initially bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. 
Total pieces of fruit = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.
Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.
Pieces of fruit left = 14 - 2 = 12.
The answer is 12.

Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the total time it takes for one person to paint a whole house.
2. Calculate the painting rate of one person in terms of houses per day.
3. Multiply the painting rate by the number of people to find the combined rate for 5 people.
4. Calculate the total time it takes for 5 people to paint the whole house using their combined rate.
5. Convert the total time from days to hours, as required by the question.

Answer:
1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house.
2. The painting rate of one person is 1 house per 10 days, which is 1/10 houses per day.
3. The combined rate for 5 people is 5 times the rate of one person, which is 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 houses per day.
4. The total time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is 1 / (1/2) = 2 days.
5. Converting 2 days to hours, we get 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Task 415: 1.00
Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Define variables for the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
2. Calculate the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees and sum up her total apples.
3. Calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the tallest and shortest trees.
4. Establish an equation that represents the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters.
5. Solve the equation to find out the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

Answer:
1. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
2. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples from the shortest trees. Therefore, her total apples are \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
3. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \), and three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \). Therefore, the total apples her sister gathers are \( 60 + 45 = 105 \).
4. The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is \( 45 + x + 105 = 500 \).
5. Solve the equation:
   \[
   45 + x + 105 = 500
   \]
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: ### Strategy:

1. **Calculate Blake's Total Distance:**
   - Determine the distance Blake covers by running back and forth on the 100-yard football field 15 times.
     - One round trip (back and forth) on a 100-yard field = 100 yards there + 100 yards back = 200 yards.
     - Blake runs 15 round trips: 15 * 200 yards = 3000 yards.

2. **Calculate Kelly's Total Distance:**
   - Calculate the distance Kelly runs by going back and forth on the 100-yard field once.
     - One round trip on a 100-yard field = 100 yards there + 100 yards back = 200 yards.
   - Calculate the distance she covers by running to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
     - One trip to the 40-yard line and back = 40 yards there + 40 yards back = 80 yards.
     - Kelly runs 34 round trips to the 40-yard line and back: 34 * 80 yards = 2720 yards.
   - Total distance run by Kelly = 200 yards (first round trip) + 2720 yards (34 round trips) = 2920 yards.

3. **Compare Distances:**
   - Blake's total distance = 3000 yards.
   - Kelly's total distance = 2920 yards.
   - Difference in distance = 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards.

The answer is 80.

Ground Truth: Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.
#### 1920
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total volume of soil needed to fill all the raised beds. This will involve determining the volume of one raised bed and then multiplying that volume by the number of beds. After finding the total volume, I will determine how many bags of potting soil are required by dividing the total volume by the volume that each bag can hold. Finally, I will calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Answer:
Volume of one raised bed = 2 feet (width) * 8 feet (length) * 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet.
Total volume for 10 raised beds = 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.
Number of bags required = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags.
Total cost = 160 bags * $12 per bag = $1920.

Ground Truth: Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.
#### 273
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the fraction of the skein of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma.
2. Convert these fractions into actual yardage by multiplying each fraction by the total number of yards in a skein (364 yards).
3. Add the yardage used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total yardage used altogether.

Answer:
Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91\) yards.
Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182\) yards.
Total yardage used: \(91 + 182 = 273\) yards.
The answer is 273

Ground Truth: First find the total number of spider legs: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = <<80*8=640>>640 legs
Then find the total number of insect legs: 90 spiders * 6 legs/spider = <<90*6=540>>540 legs
Then find the total number of mutant invertebrate legs: 3 mutants * 10 legs/mutant = <<3*10=30>>30 legs
Then add the number of each kind of leg to find the total he saw: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs
#### 1210
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, I will first calculate the number of legs for each category of creatures separately by multiplying the number of creatures by the number of legs each creature has. Then, I will sum the results of these calculations to get the total number of legs. Specifically, I will:

1. Multiply the number of spiders (80) by the number of legs each spider has (8).
2. Multiply the number of insects (90) by the number of legs each insect has (6).
3. Multiply the number of rare mutant invertebrates (3) by the number of legs each mutant invertebrate has (10).
4. Add the results from the three calculations to find the total number of legs Jake sees.

Answer:
1. 80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs
2. 90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs
3. 3 rare mutant invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs
4. Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210

The answer is 1210

Ground Truth: Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel who went down 30 times so that's .30*30 = <<30*.01*30=9>>9 times less
Mitchel went down 30 times and Anne went down 9 times less than him for a total of 30-9 = <<30-9=21>>21 times
Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, who went down 21 times so Robert went down the slide 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 times
#### 84
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the number of times Anne went down the water slide by calculating 30% less than the number of times Mitchel went down.
2. Calculate the exact number of times Anne went down the slide using the result from step 1.
3. Use the number from step 2 to determine how many times Robert went down the water slide by multiplying Anne's number by 4.
4. The result from step 3 will give the total number of times Robert went down the water slide.

Answer:
1. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which is 30 times - 30% of 30 times.
2. 30% of 30 times is 0.30 * 30 = 9 times. Therefore, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.
3. Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, which is 4 * 21 = 84 times.
The answer is 84

Ground Truth: Max’s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.
Cookie Monster’s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.
Summer’s total cookie amount is 73+23 = <<73+23=96>>96.
Total amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.
#### 298
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Identify the number of cookies Katarina has and use it to determine the number of cookies Max has.
2. Use the number of cookies Max has to calculate the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
3. Use the number of cookies Max has to determine how many cookies Summer has.
4. Sum the number of cookies that Katarina, Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have to find the total number of cookies.

Answer:
1. Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has \( 68 + 5 = 73 \) cookies.
2. Max has 73 cookies and he has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has \( 73 - 12 = 61 \) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Therefore, Summer has \( 73 + 23 = 96 \) cookies.
4. The total number of cookies is \( 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \).

The answer is 298.
