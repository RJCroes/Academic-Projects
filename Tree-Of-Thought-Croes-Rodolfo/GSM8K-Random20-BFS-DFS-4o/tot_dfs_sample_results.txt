Ground Truth: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the total number of servings Cynthia will consume over 60 days, given that she eats one serving per day.
2. Calculate how many cartons of ice cream she will need to purchase to cover the 60 servings, considering that each carton contains 15 servings.
3. Multiply the number of cartons needed by the cost per carton to find the total amount she will spend on ice cream over the 60-day period.

Answer:
1. Over 60 days, Cynthia will consume 60 servings of ice cream.
2. Since each carton contains 15 servings, she will need to purchase 60 / 15 = 4 cartons.
3. The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total amount spent will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

The answer is 16

Ground Truth: Kira bought 3 + 5 + 6 = <<3+5+6=14>>14 pieces of fruit.
After Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit there are 14 - 2 = <<14-2=12>>12 pieces of fruit.
#### 12
Generated Solution: Strategy:
First, determine the total number of pieces of fruit Kira initially bought by adding the quantities of apples, bananas, and oranges together. Then, subtract the number of pieces of fruit that Lola ate from this total to find out how many pieces are left.

Answer:
Kira initially bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. Adding these together gives:
3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit.

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, so subtracting this from the total gives:
14 - 2 = 12 pieces of fruit left.

The answer is 12.

Task 135: 1.00
Ground Truth: If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.
#### 40
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the current number of video games Brian has, accounting for the 5 he lost.
2. Establish the relationship between the number of video games Brian currently has and the number Bobby has, using the information that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian.
3. Calculate the exact number of video games Bobby has based on the relationship established in step 2.

Answer:
1. Brian originally had 20 video games but lost 5, so he currently has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.
2. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. Therefore, Bobby's number of video games can be calculated as 3 times Brian's current number minus 5.
3. Bobby has 3 * 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 video games.
The answer is 40.

Ground Truth: Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.
#### 240
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. Determine the height of Mattison's house by multiplying his height by seven.
2. Calculate the height of the first floor by multiplying Mattison's height by three.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the combined height of the second floor and the roof space.
4. Since we need to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, the height of the second floor will be equal to Mattison's height because the first floor's ceiling height is given as thrice his height.
5. Subtract Mattison's height (the height of the second floor) from the combined height of the second floor and the roof space to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

**Solution:**

1. Mattison's height = 60 inches
   Height of the house = 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches

2. Height of the first floor = 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches

3. Combined height of the second floor and the roof space = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches

4. Height of the second floor = Mattison's height = 60 inches

5. Height of the roof from the second floor's floor = 240 inches - 60 inches = 180 inches

The answer is 180

Ground Truth: First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.
#### 48
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the amount of work one person can complete in a single day.
2. Calculate the total amount of work required to paint the whole house.
3. Establish how much work 5 people can complete in a single day collectively.
4. Calculate the total number of days it will take for 5 people to complete the whole house.
5. Convert the total number of days into hours to find the final answer.

Answer:
1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days, so one person can paint \( \frac{1}{2} \) house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint \( \frac{1}{2} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10} \) of a house in one day.
2. The total amount of work required to paint the whole house is 1 house.
3. Five people working together can paint \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) house in one day.
4. To paint the whole house, it will take \( 1 \div \frac{1}{2} = 2 \) days for 5 people.
5. There are 24 hours in a day, so it will take \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) hours for 5 people to paint the whole house.

Ground Truth: The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.
#### 260
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost for the two implants by adding the base price for both implants and the additional cost for the porcelain crown.
2. Subtract the deposit George has already paid from the total cost to determine the remaining amount he needs to pay.
3. Determine George's hourly wage.
4. Calculate the number of hours George needs to work by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage.
5. Round up to the nearest whole number if necessary, since George cannot work a fraction of an hour.

Answer:
1. Total cost for two implants = 2 * $2000 = $4000.
   Additional cost for porcelain crown = $500.
   Total cost = $4000 + $500 = $4500.
2. Remaining amount after deposit = $4500 - $600 = $3900.
3. George's hourly wage = $15 per hour.
4. Number of hours needed to work = $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.
5. The answer is 260.

Task 415: 1.00
Ground Truth: Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Identify and define the variables for the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
2. Calculate the total number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest and shortest trees.
   - Tallest trees: 30 apples
   - Shortest trees: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) apples
   - Total from tallest and shortest: \( 30 + 15 = 45 \) apples
3. Calculate the total number of apples her sister gathers from the tallest and shortest trees.
   - Tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - Shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - Total from tallest and shortest: \( 60 + 45 = 105 \) apples
4. Set up an equation incorporating the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters (500 apples).
   - Joanne's total: \( 45 + x \)
   - Sister's total: 105
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 500 \)
5. Solve for the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees using the equation.
   - \( 45 + x + 105 = 500 \)
   - \( x + 150 = 500 \)
   - \( x = 500 - 150 \)
   - \( x = 350 \)
6. Verify the solution by ensuring the sum of apples gathered by both sisters equals 500 apples.
   - Joanne: \( 45 + 350 = 395 \)
   - Sister: \( 105 \)
   - Combined total: \( 395 + 105 = 500 \)

Task 409: 1.00
Ground Truth: When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. **Determine the Number of Employees in Each Month:**
   - May: 40 employees
   - June: 40 employees - (1/4 * 40 employees) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees

2. **Calculate the Total Hours Worked:**
   - May: 40 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 6400 hours
   - June: 30 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 4800 hours

3. **Calculate Monthly Payroll Costs:**
   - May: 6400 hours * $15/hour = $96,000
   - June: 4800 hours * $15/hour = $72,000

4. **Sum the Monthly Payroll Costs:**
   - Total amount paid = $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000

Ground Truth: Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. Determine the total distance Blake runs:
   - Calculate the distance for one round trip on the football field (back and forth): 100 yards + 100 yards = 200 yards.
   - Multiply this distance by the number of round trips Blake completes: 200 yards * 15 = 3000 yards.

2. Determine the total distance Kelly runs:
   - Calculate the distance for one round trip across the entire football field (back and forth): 100 yards + 100 yards = 200 yards.
   - Calculate the distance for one round trip to the 40-yard line and back: 40 yards + 40 yards = 80 yards.
   - Multiply the distance to the 40-yard line and back by the number of times Kelly completes this trip: 80 yards * 34 = 2720 yards.
   - Add the distance from Kelly's single full round trip to the total distance from her trips to the 40-yard line: 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

3. Compare the total distances run by Blake and Kelly to determine who ran farther:
   - Blake runs 3000 yards.
   - Kelly runs 2920 yards.
   - Blake ran farther.

4. Subtract the shorter distance from the longer distance to find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser:
   - 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards.

The answer is 80.

Ground Truth: If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the initial number of shoes that Fireman Frank has.
2. Calculate the total number of shoes added during the week by converting the number of pairs gained on each day to individual shoes.
3. Sum the initial number of shoes and the additional shoes gained throughout the week to get the total before any are discarded.
4. Subtract the number of shoes Fireman Frank gets rid of on Saturday from the total number of shoes he has before Saturday.
5. The result will be the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday.

Answer:
1. Initial number of shoes: 200
2. Calculate shoes added:
   - Monday: 5 pairs = 5 * 2 = 10 shoes
   - Wednesday: 15 pairs = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes
   - Friday: 30 pairs = 30 * 2 = 60 shoes
3. Total shoes before discarding:
   200 (initial) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes
4. Subtract shoes discarded on Saturday:
   300 - 180 = 120

Ground Truth: Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.
#### 273
Generated Solution: **Strategy:**

1. **Determine the Fractional Yards Used by Each Person:**
   - Calculate the number of yards Mariah used by finding 1/4 of the total yards in a skein.
   - Calculate the number of yards Mariah's grandma used by finding 1/2 of the total yards in a skein.

2. **Calculate the Total Yards Used:**
   - Add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to get the total yards of yarn used altogether.

3. **Combine the Results:**
   - Sum the two fractional results to get the final total in yards.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the Fractional Yards Used by Each Person:**
   - Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 364 yards: 
     \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]
   - Mariah's grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 364 yards: 
     \[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

2. **Calculate the Total Yards Used:**
   - Add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:
     \[ 91 \text{ yards} + 182 \text{ yards} = 273 \text{ yards} \]

3. **Combine the Results:**
   - The total yards of yarn used altogether is:
     \[ 273 \]

The answer is 273

Ground Truth: First find the total number of spider legs: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = <<80*8=640>>640 legs
Then find the total number of insect legs: 90 spiders * 6 legs/spider = <<90*6=540>>540 legs
Then find the total number of mutant invertebrate legs: 3 mutants * 10 legs/mutant = <<3*10=30>>30 legs
Then add the number of each kind of leg to find the total he saw: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs
#### 1210
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, I will first calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature separately by multiplying the number of creatures by the number of legs each creature has. Specifically, I will multiply the number of spiders by 8, the number of insects by 6, and the number of rare mutant invertebrates by 10. After finding these individual totals, I will then sum all these results to get the overall total number of legs Jake sees.

Answer:
Total legs from spiders = 80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs
Total legs from insects = 90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs
Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = 3 invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs
Total number of legs = 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs
The answer is 1210

Task 254: 1.00
Ground Truth: Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel who went down 30 times so that's .30*30 = <<30*.01*30=9>>9 times less
Mitchel went down 30 times and Anne went down 9 times less than him for a total of 30-9 = <<30-9=21>>21 times
Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, who went down 21 times so Robert went down the slide 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 times
#### 84
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the number of times Anne went down the water slide by calculating 30% less than the number of times Mitchel went down.
2. Calculate the exact number of times Anne went down the slide based on the result from step 1.
3. Calculate the number of times Robert went down the water slide by multiplying the number of times Anne went down by 4.
4. Provide the final number of times Robert went down the water slide.

Answer:
1. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel.
2. 30% of 30 is 0.30 * 30 = 9. So, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.
3. Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so Robert went down 4 * 21 = 84 times.
4. The answer is 84.

Task 681: 1.00
Ground Truth: Max’s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.
Cookie Monster’s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.
Summer’s total cookie amount is 73+23 = <<73+23=96>>96.
Total amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.
#### 298
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the number of cookies Max has by adding 5 to the number of cookies Katarina has, since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
2. Determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from the number of cookies Max has, since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
3. Determine the number of cookies Summer has by adding 23 to the number of cookies Max has, since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
4. Calculate the total number of cookies by summing the cookies that Katarina, Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have.

Answer:
1. Katarina has 68 cookies. Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
2. The Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
3. Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.
4. Total number of cookies = 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer).

68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

The answer is 298
