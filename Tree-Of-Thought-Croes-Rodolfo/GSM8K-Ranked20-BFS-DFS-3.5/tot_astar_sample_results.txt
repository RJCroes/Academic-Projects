Ground Truth: First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.
#### 131250
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, I will first calculate the number of each type of bike sold: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. Then, I will calculate the total revenue generated from selling each type of bike and finally, add them together to get the total earnings for the month.

Number of MTB sold = 300 bikes * (1 - 0.5 - 0.15) = 120 bikes
Number of BMX sold = 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 bikes
Number of Trekking sold = 300 bikes * 0.5 = 150 bikes

Total revenue from MTB = 120 bikes * $500 = $60,000
Total revenue from BMX = 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = $11,250
Total revenue from Trekking = 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings for the month = $60,000 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $138,750

The answer is 138750

Ground Truth: The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.
#### 145
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the arrival time of each train relative to the first train.
2. Calculate the total waiting time for each train.
3. Add up the waiting times for the first three trains to determine how long Paul will wait for his train.

Answer:
Paul will wait for a total of 50 minutes. 
The answer is 50

Task 16: 1.00
Ground Truth: First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes
Then find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month
#### 1128
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in one week by adding the time spent recording videos, writing songs, and doing makeup.
2. Multiply the total time spent on TikTok in one week by four (for four weeks in a month) to get the total time spent on TikTok in a month.

Answer:
Total time spent on TikTok in one week = (18 videos * 4 minutes per video) + 2 hours + (15 minutes * 6 days)
= (72 minutes) + 2 hours + 90 minutes
= 72 + 120 + 90
= 282 minutes per week

Total time spent on TikTok in one month = 282 minutes per week * 4 weeks
= 1128 minutes

The answer is 1128.

Car fuel costs him 1/3*$6000 = $<<6000*1/3=2000>>2000
Total expenses amount to $2000+$1500 = $<<2000+1500=3500>>3500
The total amount of money he remains with is $6000-$3500 = $<<6000-3500=2500>>2500
He donates half of the remaining amount, which is 1/2*$2500 = $<<1/2*2500=1250>>1250
The total amount of money given to his wife and daughter is $200+$700 = $<<200+700=900>>900
After the amount that he gave the wife and daughter, the total amount remaining is $1250-$900 = $<<1250-900=350>>350
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how much Zaid spends on rent: 1/4 of 6000$ = 1500$
2. Calculate how much Zaid spends on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000$ = 2000$
3. Calculate how much money Zaid has left after rent and car fuel expenses: 6000$ - 1500$ - 2000$ = 2500$
4. Calculate how much Zaid donates to his favorite charity: 1/2 of 2500$ = 1250$
5. Subtract the amount donated from the remaining money: 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$
6. Subtract the amount given to his daughter and wife: 1250$ - 200$ - 700$ = 350$
7. Calculate the final amount of money Zaid will have after all expenses and donations: 350$

Task 19: 1.00
Ground Truth: Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.
#### 145
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how many points Betty has by adding 30% more points to Adam's total.
2. Determine how many points Tom has by subtracting 30 points from Betty's total.
3. Calculate Martha's total points by multiplying Tom's total by 3.
4. Add up all the points collected by Adam, Betty, Tom, and Martha to find the total points collected by the class.
5. Calculate how many more points the class needs to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points for the trip.

Answer:
Adam: 50 points
Betty: 50 + 30% of 50 = 50 + 15 = 65 points
Tom: 65 - 30 = 35 points
Martha: 35 * 3 = 105 points

Total points collected by the class: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

Points needed for the trip: 400 - 255 = 145 points

Ground Truth: Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining
#### 79
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower: 3 flowers with 5 petals each, 4 flowers with 6 petals each, 5 flowers with 4 petals each, and 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
2. Add up the total number of petals for each type of flower.
3. Subtract 1 petal from each type of flower to account for the flowers that were dropped and blown away.
4. Add up the remaining total number of petals for all the flowers to determine the final answer.

Answer:
Total number of petals for each type of flower: 
3 flowers with 5 petals = 3 * 5 = 15 petals
4 flowers with 6 petals = 4 * 6 = 24 petals
5 flowers with 4 petals = 5 * 4 = 20 petals
6 flowers with 7 petals = 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total number of petals for all flowers: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Subtract 1 petal from each type of flower that was dropped: 15 - 1 + 24 - 1 + 20 - 1 + 42 - 1 = 99 petals

The answer is 99.

Task 12: 0.40
Ground Truth: The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.
#### 2
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how much chalk is left after Monday.
2. Determine how much chalk the teacher can use each day before reaching the 2-inch threshold.
3. Divide the remaining chalk by the daily usage to find out how many days the teacher has left before needing to recycle the chalk.

After Monday, the teacher has used 45% of the chalk, which means 100% - 45% = 55% of the chalk is remaining.
Since the original length of the chalk is 5 inches, 55% of 5 inches is 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

The teacher can only use the chalk until it is 2 inches long. Therefore, the teacher can use 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches of chalk before needing to recycle.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, the teacher can use 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch of chalk per day.

Therefore, the teacher has 3 inches of chalk left and can use it for 3 inches / 1 inch per day = 3 days before needing to recycle the chalk.

Ground Truth: Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games
Steve then buys 2 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*2=<<2*12=24>>24 games
Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games
Since Steve started with 5 games, he has 5+99=<<5+99=104>>104 games after 3 years
#### 104
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of games Steve receives in a year, including the console and games for his birthday and Christmas.
2. Determine how many games Steve buys each month for the first year, second year, and third year.
3. Add up all the games received and bought over the three years to find the total number of games Steve has.

Answer:
Total games received in a year: 5 (birthday) + 5 (Christmas) = 10 games
Total games bought per year: 12 (1 game per month for the first year) + 24 (2 games per month for the second year) + 48 (4 games per month for the third year) = 84 games

Total games after 3 years: 10 (gifts) + 84 (bought) = 94 games

Ground Truth: Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours
#### 11
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how long Jack can play with 1 quarter (20 minutes).
2. Determine how long Jack's two friends who are worse than him can play (10 minutes each).
3. Figure out how long Jack's friend who is better than him can play (30 minutes).
4. Add up the total time all 4 friends played for (4 hours = 240 minutes).
5. Calculate how many quarters were used based on the total time played by each friend.
6. Multiply the number of quarters used by the cost of each quarter to find out how much money was used in total.

Answer:
Jack played for 240/20 = 12 quarters
Two friends played for (240/20)/2 = 6 quarters each
One friend played for (240/20)*1.5 = 18 quarters
Total quarters used = 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters
Cost per quarter = $0.25
Total money used = 42 * $0.25 = $10.50

Task 7: 1.00
Ground Truth: First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400
#### 8400
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the gross annual income for both jobs.
2. Calculate the total taxes paid for each job.
3. Subtract the total taxes paid from the gross annual income to find the net pay for each job.
4. Compare the net pay for both jobs and calculate the difference to determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate.

Answer:
For Job A:
Gross annual income = $15/hr * 2000 hrs = $30,000
Total tax paid = $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
Net pay = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
Net income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Total tax paid = $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
Net pay = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Difference in net pay = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Ground Truth: Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.
#### 5
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart by finding the cost of the chicken, strawberries, and apples.
2. Subtract the total cost of all items from Kelly's budget of $65 to find out how much money she has left.

Answer:
Total cost of chicken: 6 packets * 2 packs of bacon * $2 = $24
Total cost of strawberries: 3 packs * $4 = $12
Total cost of apples: 7 packs * 0.5 * $4 = $14
Total cost of all items: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60
Money left in Kelly's budget: $65 - $60 = $5

The service includes 10 pictures and she has 20 to that's 20-10 = <<20-10=10>>10 extra pictures
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 10*15 = $<<10*15=150.00>>150.00
The service costs $129.00 and the extra mirrors are $30.00, the chandelier is $15.00 and the pictures are $150.00 for a total of 129+30+15+150 = $<<129+30+15+150=324.00>>324.00
#### 324
Generated Solution: Strategy:
First, calculate the cost for the installation of the original items included in the $129.00 package. Then, calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs installed by multiplying the number of additional items by $15.00. Finally, add the two costs together to find the total cost for Angela.

Answer:
Cost for original installation: $129.00
Cost for additional 6 mirrors: 6 x $15.00 = $90.00
Cost for additional 2 chandeliers: 2 x $15.00 = $30.00
Cost for additional 20 pictures: 20 x $15.00 = $300.00
Total cost: $129.00 + $90.00 + $30.00 + $300.00 = $549.00

His has a 10% coupon for his $50.00 purchase so that saves him .10*50 = $<<10*.01*50=5.00>>5.00
His total bill is $50 minus his discount of $5.00 so 50-5 = $<<50-5=45.00>>45.00
#### 45
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of each item category separately:
- Croissants: 5 croissants x $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls x $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches x $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins x $1.00 = $13.00

2. Add up the total cost of all item categories to get the subtotal:
$15.00 (croissants) + $10.00 (cinnamon rolls) + $12.00 (mini quiches) + $13.00 (blueberry muffins) = $50.00

3. Apply the 10% discount from Marcus' loyalty card to the subtotal to find the final total bill:
$50.00 subtotal - 10% discount ($5.00) = $45.00

Ground Truth: Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons
#### 34
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate 40% of 25 red balloons to find out how many burst.
2. Calculate half of 12 yellow balloons to find out how many were accidentally released.
3. Add the remaining red and yellow balloons to the green balloons to find out the total number of balloons Sally had before finding the blue balloons.
4. Calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons to find out how many she added to her remaining clutch.
5. Add the total number of balloons after adding the blue balloons to find out how many she finally carried into the school.

Answer:
Sally finally carried 31 balloons into the school.

Ground Truth: He orders 2 sauces at $0.25 each so 2*.25 = $<<2*.25=0.50>>0.50 for sauce
He orders extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00 and $0.50 for sauce for a total of 2+1+1+.50 = $<<2+1+1+.5=4.50>>4.50 in extras
His burrito cost $6.50 and he adds $4.50 in extras and upgrades his meal for $3.00 so now he owes, 6.50+4.50+3 = $<<6.50+4.50+3=14.00>>14.00
He has a $5.00 gift card and his current bill is $14.00 so he will owe 14-5 = $<<14-5=9.00>>9.00
#### 9
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the burrito with all the add-ons: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + ($0.25 x 2) = $10.00
2. Add the cost of the upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00
3. Subtract the amount covered by the gift card: $5.00
4. The remaining amount is what Chad still owes: $10.00 + $3.00 - $5.00 = $8.00

Task 9: 1.00
Ground Truth: First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points
Now add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points
#### 41
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of points available for the multiple-choice questions, true/false questions, and long-answer questions separately.
2. Calculate the number of questions Amy answered correctly for each type of question.
3. Calculate the total number of points Amy scored for each type of question.
4. Add up the total points scored for each type of question to get Amy's overall score on the history test.

Answer:
Total points available for multiple-choice questions: 10 * 1 = 10 points
Total points available for true/false questions: 20 * 1 = 20 points
Total points available for long-answer questions: 5 * 5 = 25 points

Number of multiple-choice questions answered correctly: 10 * 80% = 8 questions
Number of true/false questions answered correctly: 20 * 90% = 18 questions
Number of long-answer questions answered correctly: 5 * 60% = 3 questions

Total points scored for multiple-choice questions: 8 points
Total points scored for true/false questions: 18 points
Total points scored for long-answer questions: 3 * 5 = 15 points

Amy's overall score on the history test: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41

Task 8: 0.70
Ground Truth: He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1
#### 1
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total amount spent on tickets, popcorn, and candy so far.
Total spent on tickets = ($10 x 5) + ($7 x 8) = $50 + $56 = $106
Total spent on popcorn = $8 x 2 = $16
Total spent on candy = $2 x 4 = $8
Total amount spent so far = $106 + $16 + $8 = $130

2. Subtract the total amount spent from the $150 given by his parents to determine how much he has left to spend.
Amount left to spend = $150 - $130 = $20

3. Determine the cost of the movie night he wants (ticket for Friday, popcorn, candy).
Cost of movie night = $10 (ticket) + $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $20

4. Calculate how many more movies he can see based on the remaining amount he has to spend.
Number of movies he can see = $20 / $20 = 1

Ground Truth: On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons
#### 6000
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how many gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank on the first day.
2. Calculate how many gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank on the second day.
3. Add up the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.
4. Subtract the total amount of water pumped into the tank from the tank's capacity to find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full.

Answer:
On the first day, Wanda filled 18000 * 1/4 = 4500 gallons of water.
Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons of water on the first day.
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons of water.
Ms. B pumped 1/3 * 4500 = 1500 gallons of water on the second day.
The total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B on both days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1500 = 12375 gallons.
The remaining amount of water for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12375 = 5625.
The answer is 5625.

Ground Truth: She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance
The frying pan is 20% off of $20.00 so .20*20.00 = $<<20*.01*20=4.00>>4.00
The frying pan costs $20.00 and the discount price is $4.00 so the new price is 20-4=$<<20-4=16.00>>16.00
The towel set is 10% off of $30.00 so .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00
The towel set costs $30.00 and the discount price is $3.00 so the new price is 30-3= $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00
Her new purchases total 16+27 = $$<<16+27=43.00>>43.00
After the return, her card balance was $70.00 and she just added $43.00 in purchases so her new balance is 70+43 = $<<70+43=113.00>>113.00
#### 113
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the original balance Sheila charged on her credit card: $85.00
2. Calculate the refund for the returned item and subtract it from the original balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Calculate the discounted price for the frying pan and towels:
- Frying pan: $20.00 - 20% = $16.00
- Set of towels: $30.00 - 10% = $27.00
4. Add the discounted prices of the frying pan and towels to the adjusted balance from step 2 to get the new balance on her credit card: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00
