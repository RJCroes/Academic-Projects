Task 1: 1.00
Ground Truth: 5 croissants cost $3.00 each so they cost 5*3 = $<<5*3=15.00>>15.00
4 cinnamon rolls cost $2.50 each so they cost 4*2.5 =$<<4*2.5=10.00>>10.00
3 mini quiches cost $4.00 each so they cost 3*4 = $<<3*4=12.00>>12.00
13 blueberry muffins cost $1.00 each so the cost 13*1 = $<<13*1=13.00>>13.00
All total, his pastries costs 15+10+12+13 = $<<15+10+12+13=50.00>>50.00
His has a 10% coupon for his $50.00 purchase so that saves him .10*50 = $<<10*.01*50=5.00>>5.00
His total bill is $50 minus his discount of $5.00 so 50-5 = $<<50-5=45.00>>45.00
#### 45
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of each item ordered by multiplying the quantity by the price per item.
2. Add up the total cost of all items to get the subtotal.
3. Apply the 10% discount from Marcus' loyalty card to the subtotal to get the final total bill amount.

Answer:
Total cost of croissants = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
Total cost of cinnamon rolls = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
Total cost of mini quiches = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
Total cost of blueberry muffins = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Subtotal = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

10% discount = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Final total bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Task 10: 1.00
Ground Truth: Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons
#### 34
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate 40% of 25 red balloons: 0.40 x 25 = 10 red balloons burst.
2. Calculate half of 12 yellow balloons: 0.50 x 12 = 6 yellow balloons released.
3. Add remaining red, green, and yellow balloons: 25 - 10 (burst) + 7 + 12 - 6 (released) = 28 balloons.
4. Add 75% of 8 blue balloons: 0.75 x 8 = 6 blue balloons added.
5. Total number of balloons carried into the school: 28 + 6 = 34 balloons.

Ground Truth: Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games
Steve then buys 2 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*2=<<2*12=24>>24 games
Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games
Since Steve started with 5 games, he has 5+99=<<5+99=104>>104 games after 3 years
#### 104

Task 4: 1.00
Ground Truth: First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.
#### 131250
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold based on the information provided.
- Trekking bikes sold: 300 * 0.5 = 150
- BMX bikes sold: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes sold: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

2. Calculate the total earnings from selling each type of bike.
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * ($500/2) = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

3. Add up the total earnings from each type of bike to find the total amount Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month.
- Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

Ground Truth: She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance
The frying pan is 20% off of $20.00 so .20*20.00 = $<<20*.01*20=4.00>>4.00
The frying pan costs $20.00 and the discount price is $4.00 so the new price is 20-4=$<<20-4=16.00>>16.00
The towel set is 10% off of $30.00 so .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00
The towel set costs $30.00 and the discount price is $3.00 so the new price is 30-3= $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00
Her new purchases total 16+27 = $$<<16+27=43.00>>43.00
After the return, her card balance was $70.00 and she just added $43.00 in purchases so her new balance is 70+43 = $<<70+43=113.00>>113.00
#### 113
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total amount charged on Sheila's credit card by adding the original purchase amount and subtracting the returned item.
2. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount.
3. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount.
4. Add the cost of the frying pan, set of towels, and the remaining balance on the credit card to get the new balance.

Answer:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
Frying pan cost after 20% discount = $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $16.00
Set of towels cost after 10% discount = $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $27.00
New balance = $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

Ground Truth: 2 subs are $7.50 each so that’s 2*7.50 = $<<2*7.5=15.00>>15.00
2 bags of chips are $1.50 each so that’s 2*1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00
2 cookies are $1.00 each so that’s 2*1 = $<<2*1=2.00>>2.00
Her delivery order will be 15+3+2= $<<15+3+2=20.00>>20.00
There’s a 20% delivery fee on the $20.00 which adds .20*20 = $4.00 to her bill
The delivery order is $20.00, there’s a $4.00 delivery fee and she adds a $5.00 tip for a total of 20+4+5 = $<<20+4+5=29.00>>29.00
#### 29
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the food items ordered:
   2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00
   2 bags of chips * $1.50/bag = $3.00
   2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00
   Total food cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

2. Determine the delivery fee by adding 20% to the total cost of the food items:
   Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = $4.00

3. Add the $5.00 tip to the total cost:
   Total cost with tip = $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

4. Sum up all the costs to find the final delivery order cost:
   $20.00 (food) + $4.00 (delivery fee) + $5.00 (tip) = $29.00

Ground Truth: On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons
#### 6000
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how many gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.
Wanda pumped: 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons
Ms. B pumped: 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons

2. Calculate how many gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day.
Wanda pumped: 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons
Ms. B pumped: 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons

3. Add up the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.
Total gallons pumped = 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons

4. Subtract the total gallons of water pumped from the tank's capacity of 18000 gallons to find out how many gallons are remaining for the tank to be full.
18000 - 12000 = 6000

The answer is 6000.

#### 1
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find out how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month, we need to calculate how much money he has left after subtracting the expenses for the movies he has already seen, popcorn, and candy. Then we can determine how many movies he can afford based on the ticket prices for that day.

Answer:
Colby has $150 to spend at the movies each month. 
Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each, while tickets for other days cost $7 each. 
Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. 
He has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays ($10 each) and 8 movies on other days ($7 each), totaling $90. 
He has also bought 2 tubs of popcorn ($8 each) and 4 boxes of candy ($2 each), totaling $28. 
Therefore, he has $150 - $90 - $28 = $32 left to spend on the last day of the month. 
On a Friday, he can see 3 movies ($10 each) and buy a popcorn and candy ($8 + $2), totaling $32. 
Therefore, he can see 3 movies on the last day of the month.

Ground Truth: Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.
#### 5
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken by multiplying the cost of one pack of bacon by 2, then multiplying that by 6.
2. Calculate the total cost of the strawberries by multiplying the cost of one pack of strawberries by 3.
3. Calculate the total cost of the apples by dividing the cost of one pack of strawberries by 2, then multiplying that by 7.
4. Add up the total cost of all items in Kelly's cart.
5. Subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to determine how much money she has left.

Answer:
The total cost of all items in Kelly's cart is $10 for bacon, $60 for chicken, $12 for strawberries, and $14 for apples, which adds up to $96. Therefore, Kelly has $65 - $96 = $31 left in her budget. The answer is 31.

Ground Truth: Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours

Ground Truth: The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

Ground Truth: Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining
#### 79
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, I will first calculate the total number of petals on the flowers Rose picked by multiplying the number of flowers of each type by the number of petals each flower has. Then, I will subtract one petal from the total for each type of flower that Rose dropped. Finally, I will add up the remaining petals to find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase.

Answer:
Total number of petals on the flowers in the vase = (3 flowers x 5 petals each) + (4 flowers x 6 petals each) + (5 flowers x 4 petals each) + (6 flowers x 7 petals each) - 4 petals (1 of each type of flower dropped)
Total number of petals on the flowers in the vase = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 - 4
Total number of petals on the flowers in the vase = 97
The answer is 97

Ground Truth: The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.
#### 2
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the initial amount of chalk used on Monday:
Initial amount of chalk = 5 inches
Amount used on Monday = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

2. Calculate the remaining amount of chalk after Monday:
Remaining amount of chalk = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

3. Calculate how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk if only 20% is used each day:
Amount used each day = 20% of 5 inches = 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch
Number of days to use up remaining chalk = 2.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 2.75 days

4. Add the number of days from step 3 to 1 (since Monday was the first day) to determine how many days before the chalk needs to be recycled:
Number of days before chalk needs to be recycled = 2.75 days + 1 day = 3.75 days

The answer is 3.

Ground Truth: Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.
#### 145
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the number of points Betty has collected by adding 30% more to Adam's points.
2. Calculate the number of points Marta has collected by multiplying Tom's points by 3.
3. Calculate the number of points Tom has collected by subtracting 30 points from Betty's points.
4. Add up the total points collected by all students in class 3B.
5. Calculate how many points are missing to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points for the trip.

Answer:
Adam: 50 points
Betty: 50 + 30% of 50 = 50 + 0.3*50 = 50 + 15 = 65 points
Tom: 65 - 30 = 35 points
Marta: 3 * 35 = 105 points

Total points collected: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points
Points missing for the trip: 400 - 255 = 145 points

Ground Truth: First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400
#### 8400
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total annual income for both jobs, taking into account the taxes for each state.
2. Compare the total annual income for both jobs to determine which job offers a higher net pay rate.
3. Calculate the difference in net pay between the two jobs to determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate.

Answer:
For Job A:
Total annual income = $15/hour x 2000 hours = $30,000
Total tax = $30,000 x 20% = $6,000
Net annual income for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
Net annual income = $42,000 - $6,000 (property tax) = $36,000
Total tax on net income = $36,000 x 10% = $3,600
Net annual income for Job B = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Difference in net pay = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400
