Task 1: 1.00
Ground Truth: 5 croissants cost $3.00 each so they cost 5*3 = $<<5*3=15.00>>15.00
4 cinnamon rolls cost $2.50 each so they cost 4*2.5 =$<<4*2.5=10.00>>10.00
3 mini quiches cost $4.00 each so they cost 3*4 = $<<3*4=12.00>>12.00
13 blueberry muffins cost $1.00 each so the cost 13*1 = $<<13*1=13.00>>13.00
All total, his pastries costs 15+10+12+13 = $<<15+10+12+13=50.00>>50.00
His has a 10% coupon for his $50.00 purchase so that saves him .10*50 = $<<10*.01*50=5.00>>5.00
His total bill is $50 minus his discount of $5.00 so 50-5 = $<<50-5=45.00>>45.00
#### 45
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of each type of pastry separately by multiplying the quantity by the price per item.
2. Add up the total cost of all the pastries.
3. Apply the 10% discount from the loyalty card to the total bill.
4. Calculate the final total bill after the discount is applied.

Answer:
Total cost of croissants: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
Total cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
Total cost of mini quiches: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
Total cost of blueberry muffins: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00
Total bill before discount: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00
Total bill after 10% discount: $50.00 - ($50.00 x 0.10) = $45.00

The answer is 45.

Ground Truth: Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons
#### 34

Ground Truth: First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points
Now add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points
#### 41

Ground Truth: Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games
Steve then buys 2 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*2=<<2*12=24>>24 games
Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games
Since Steve started with 5 games, he has 5+99=<<5+99=104>>104 games after 3 years
#### 104

Task 4: 1.00
Ground Truth: First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.
#### 131250
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

2. Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- MTB: 105 * $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 * ($500 / 2) = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 * $450 = $67,500

3. Add up the total earnings from selling all types of bikes to find Marcel's total earnings for the month.

Answer:
The answer is $131,250.

Ground Truth: She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance
The frying pan is 20% off of $20.00 so .20*20.00 = $<<20*.01*20=4.00>>4.00
The frying pan costs $20.00 and the discount price is $4.00 so the new price is 20-4=$<<20-4=16.00>>16.00
The towel set is 10% off of $30.00 so .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00
The towel set costs $30.00 and the discount price is $3.00 so the new price is 30-3= $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00
Her new purchases total 16+27 = $$<<16+27=43.00>>43.00
After the return, her card balance was $70.00 and she just added $43.00 in purchases so her new balance is 70+43 = $<<70+43=113.00>>113.00
#### 113
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total amount Sheila charged on her credit card initially.
2. Subtract the amount she returned from the total.
3. Calculate the price of the frying pan after the discount.
4. Calculate the price of the set of towels after the discount.
5. Add the prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to get the total amount Sheila spent after returning the item.
6. Add the total amount Sheila spent after returning the item to the amount she initially charged on her credit card to get the new balance.

Answer:
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00
20% discount on $20.00 frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
10% discount on $30.00 set of towels = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (set of towels) = $43.00
$70.00 (initial charge - returned item) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

2 bags of chips are $1.50 each so that’s 2*1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00
2 cookies are $1.00 each so that’s 2*1 = $<<2*1=2.00>>2.00
Her delivery order will be 15+3+2= $<<15+3+2=20.00>>20.00
There’s a 20% delivery fee on the $20.00 which adds .20*20 = $4.00 to her bill
The delivery order is $20.00, there’s a $4.00 delivery fee and she adds a $5.00 tip for a total of 20+4+5 = $<<20+4+5=29.00>>29.00
#### 29
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the subs, chips, and cookies.
2. Add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost.
3. Add the $5.00 tip to the total cost.
4. Calculate the final delivery order cost.

Answer:
Total cost of subs, chips, and cookies = (2 x $7.50) + (2 x $1.50) + (2 x $1.00) = $15 + $3 + $2 = $20
Delivery fee (20% of total cost) = 0.20 x $20 = $4
Total cost with delivery fee = $20 + $4 = $24
Total cost with tip = $24 + $5 = $29
The answer is 29.

Ground Truth: Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

Ground Truth: Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours
#### 11
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how long Jack can play for with 1 quarter (20 minutes).
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
2. Determine how long each of Jack's friends can play for based on their skill levels.
- Two friends can play for 10 minutes each with 1 quarter.

Ground Truth: The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

Generated Solution: Strategy:
To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we will need to calculate the arrival times and durations of the first three trains, and then add up the total waiting time until the fourth train arrives, which is the one Paul needs to board. We will use the given information about the arrival times and durations of each train to calculate the total waiting time.

Answer:
First train arrives: 10 minutes
First train stays: 20 minutes
Second train arrives: 10 + 30 = 40 minutes
Second train stays: 20 / 4 = 5 minutes
Third train arrives: 40 + 60 = 100 minutes
Total waiting time for the fourth train: 100 + 20 = 120 minutes

The answer is 120.

Ground Truth: Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining
#### 79
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower (5 petals x 3 flowers = 15 petals, 6 petals x 4 flowers = 24 petals, 4 petals x 5 flowers = 20 petals, 7 petals x 6 flowers = 42 petals).
2. Add up the total number of petals for each type of flower (15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals).
3. Subtract 1 petal from each type of flower to account for the ones that were dropped (15 - 1 = 14 petals, 24 - 1 = 23 petals, 20 - 1 = 19 petals, 42 - 1 = 41 petals).
4. Add the remaining total number of petals for each type of flower (14 + 23 + 19 + 41 = 97 petals).

Ground Truth: The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.
#### 2
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate 20% of 5 inches to determine how much chalk the teacher uses each day.
2. Determine how much chalk is left after Monday's excessive use.
3. Divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day to find out how many days until the teacher needs to recycle the chalk.

Answer:
1. 20% of 5 inches is 1 inch, so the teacher uses 1 inch of chalk per day.
2. After using 45% of the chalk on Monday, there is 55% (2.75 inches) of chalk left.
3. The teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday. Dividing this by 1 inch used per day gives us 2.75 days until the teacher needs to recycle the chalk.
The answer is 2.75

Ground Truth: When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500
Car fuel costs him 1/3*$6000 = $<<6000*1/3=2000>>2000
Total expenses amount to $2000+$1500 = $<<2000+1500=3500>>3500
The total amount of money he remains with is $6000-$3500 = $<<6000-3500=2500>>2500
He donates half of the remaining amount, which is 1/2*$2500 = $<<1/2*2500=1250>>1250
The total amount of money given to his wife and daughter is $200+$700 = $<<200+700=900>>900
After the amount that he gave the wife and daughter, the total amount remaining is $1250-$900 = $<<1250-900=350>>350
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how much money Zaid spends on rent: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500
2. Calculate how much money Zaid spends on car fuel: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000
3. Find out how much money Zaid has left after deducting the expenses for rent and car fuel: $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500
4. Calculate how much money Zaid donates to his favorite charity: 1/2 of $2500 = $1250
5. Deduct the donation amount from the remaining money: $2500 - $1250 = $1250
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife: $1250 - $200 - $700 = $350

Ground Truth: Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.
#### 145
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Start by determining the number of points Betty collected by calculating 30% more than Adam's 50 points.
2. Use Betty's total points to find out how many points Tom has by subtracting 30 points from Betty's total.
3. Calculate Martha's total points by multiplying Tom's points by 3.
4. Add up the points collected by all four students to find out the total points collected by the class.
5. Finally, subtract the total points collected by the class from the minimum threshold of 400 points to determine how many more points are needed for the class to go on the trip.

Answer:
The class is missing 80 points to go on the trip. The answer is 80.

Task 7: 1.00
Ground Truth: First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400
#### 8400
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after taxes. We will then compare the two net pay amounts to find the difference. We will consider all taxes that apply to each job and use the given information to calculate the net pay for each job.

Answer:
For Job A:
Net pay = $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
Total tax = 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
Net pay after tax = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
Net income = $42,000 - $6,000 (property tax) = $36,000
Total tax = 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
Net pay after tax = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Difference in net pay = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The answer is 8,400
