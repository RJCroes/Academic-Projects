Task 10: 0.40
Ground Truth: Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons
#### 34
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate 40% of the red balloons that burst: 25 * 0.4 = 10 red balloons burst.
2. Calculate half of the yellow balloons that were accidentally released: 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.
3. Add the remaining red and yellow balloons together: 25 - 10 + 12 - 6 = 21 balloons remaining.
4. Calculate 75% of the blue balloons that were added: 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons added.
5. Add the blue balloons to the remaining total of red and yellow balloons: 21 + 6 = 27 balloons carried into the school.

Task 16: 0.40
Ground Truth: First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes
Then find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month
#### 1128
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok per week by adding the time spent recording videos, writing songs, and doing makeup.
Total time per week = (18 videos * 4 minutes) + 2 hours + (15 minutes * 6 days)
Total time per week = (72 minutes) + 2 hours + (90 minutes)
Total time per week = 2 hours + 2 hours + 30 minutes
Total time per week = 4 hours 30 minutes

2. Multiply the total time spent on TikTok per week by the number of weeks in a month (4) to find the total time spent on TikTok in a month.
Total time in a month = 4 hours 30 minutes * 4 weeks
Total time in a month = 18 hours + 120 minutes
Total time in a month = 20 hours

Answer:
The answer is 20.

Task 9: 1.00
Ground Truth: First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points
Now add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points
#### 41
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total number of points available for each type of question (multiple-choice, true/false, long answer).
2. Determine how many questions Amy answered correctly for each type.
3. Calculate the total number of points Amy scored for each type of question.
4. Add up the total points scored for each type of question to get Amy's overall score on the test.

Task 18: 1.00
Ground Truth: Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games
Steve then buys 2 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*2=<<2*12=24>>24 games
Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games
Since Steve started with 5 games, he has 5+99=<<5+99=104>>104 games after 3 years
#### 104
Generated Solution: Strategy:
- Year 1: Steve starts with 5 games. He buys 12 games (1 per month) and receives 5 games for Christmas. Total games after year 1: 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games.
- Year 2: Steve starts with 22 games. He buys 24 games (2 per month) and receives 5 games for Christmas. Total games after year 2: 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.
- Year 3: Steve starts with 51 games. He buys 48 games (4 per month) and receives 5 games for Christmas. Total games after year 3: 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games.

Task 4: 1.00
Ground Truth: First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.
#### 131250
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:
- Trekking bikes sold = 300 / 2 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes sold = 300 * 0.15 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

2. Calculate the total earnings from selling each type of bike:
- Total earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Total earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * ($500 / 2) = $11,250
- Total earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

3. Add up the total earnings from selling each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

Ground Truth: On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

Task 8: 0.60
Ground Truth: He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1
#### 1

Task 5: 1.00
Ground Truth: Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

Task 17: 0.30
Ground Truth: Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours
#### 11
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how long Jack can play with 1 quarter (20 minutes).
2. Determine how long his two friends who are worse than him can play (10 minutes each).
3. Calculate how long his friend who is better than him can play (30 minutes).
4. Add up the total playtime for all 4 friends.
5. Calculate the total number of quarters needed for 4 hours of playtime.
6. Convert the total number of quarters to dollars.

Answer:
Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. His two friends can play for 10 minutes each, and his other friend can play for 30 minutes. 
Total playtime for all 4 friends = 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.
In 4 hours (240 minutes), they would need 240/70 = 3.43 sets of playtime.
Since they need to pay for a full set each time, they would need 4 sets of quarters.
Therefore, the total amount of money used is 4 quarters, which is equivalent to $1.
The answer is 1.

Ground Truth: The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.
#### 145
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, I will calculate the arrival times of each train based on the information provided. I will then identify when the fourth train, the one Paul needs to board, will arrive at the station. Finally, I will calculate the total time Paul will wait by subtracting the arrival time of the fourth train from the current time.

Answer:
The fourth train will arrive at the station 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train leaves immediately, the fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train arrives. 
The third train is scheduled to arrive 1 hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train stays in the station for 5 minutes (1/4 of the time the first train stays), the second train leaves 30 minutes after the first train arrives. 
Therefore, the third train will arrive 1 hour after the second train leaves, which is 1 hour and 30 minutes after the first train arrives. 
This means the fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train arrives, which is 1 hour and 50 minutes after the first train arrives. 
So, Paul will have to wait for 1 hour and 50 minutes for his train.

Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining
#### 79
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, I will first calculate the total number of petals on the flowers Rose picked. Then, I will subtract 4 (1 petal from each type of flower that was dropped) from that total to find the final answer.

Ground Truth: The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.
#### 2

1. Calculate how much chalk is left after Monday.
2. Determine how much chalk will be used each day if only 20% is used.
3. Divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day to find out how many days until the chalk needs to be recycled.

Answer:
After Monday, the teacher has 100% - 45% = 55% of the chalk left, which is 5 inches x 0.55 = 2.75 inches.
If the teacher uses only 20% of the chalk each day, he will use 5 inches x 0.20 = 1 inch of chalk per day.
Therefore, the teacher has 2.75 inches / 1 inch/day = 2.75 days before he has to recycle this piece.
The answer is 2.

Ground Truth: When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500
Car fuel costs him 1/3*$6000 = $<<6000*1/3=2000>>2000
Total expenses amount to $2000+$1500 = $<<2000+1500=3500>>3500
The total amount of money he remains with is $6000-$3500 = $<<6000-3500=2500>>2500
He donates half of the remaining amount, which is 1/2*$2500 = $<<1/2*2500=1250>>1250
The total amount of money given to his wife and daughter is $200+$700 = $<<200+700=900>>900
After the amount that he gave the wife and daughter, the total amount remaining is $1250-$900 = $<<1250-900=350>>350
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how much money Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and donations.
2. Subtract the total amount spent on rent, car fuel, and donations from Zaid's monthly salary.
3. Deduct the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount to find out how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations.

Ground Truth: Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.
#### 145
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Determine the number of points each student has collected based on the given information:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 30% more than Adam = 50 + 0.30*50 = 65 points
- Marta: 3 times more points than Tom = 3*30 = 90 points
- Tom: 30 points less than Betty = 65 - 30 = 35 points

2. Calculate the total number of points collected by all students in class 3B:
Total points = 50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 90 (Marta) + 35 (Tom) = 240 points

3. Find out how many points are missing to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points for the trip:
Missing points = 400 - 240 = 160 points

Answer:
The answer is 160.

Ground Truth: First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400
#### 8400
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total income for Job A by multiplying $15 by 2000 hours to get $30,000, then subtract 20% for taxes to get $24,000.
2. Calculate the total income for Job B by subtracting $6,000 property tax from $42,000 annual salary to get $36,000, then apply a 10% tax rate to get $3,600 in taxes, resulting in $32,400 net pay.
3. Compare the net pay for both jobs: Job B pays $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

The answer is $8,400
