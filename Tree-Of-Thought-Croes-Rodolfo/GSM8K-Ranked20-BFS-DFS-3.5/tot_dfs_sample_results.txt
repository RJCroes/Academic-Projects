Ground Truth: Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons
#### 34

Ground Truth: First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points
Now add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points

Task 18: 0.80
Ground Truth: Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games
Steve then buys 2 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*2=<<2*12=24>>24 games
Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games
Since Steve started with 5 games, he has 5+99=<<5+99=104>>104 games after 3 years
#### 104
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, I will calculate the total number of games he receives each year (from his birthday, monthly purchases, part-time job, and Christmas gifts) and then add up the total number of games over the 3 years. I will then sum up all the games to find the final total.

Answer:
Total games in the first year: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly purchases) + 5 (Christmas) = 22
Total games in the second year: 12 (monthly purchases) + 12 (monthly purchases) + 5 (Christmas) = 29
Total games in the third year: 48 (monthly purchases) + 5 (Christmas) = 53

Total games after 3 years: 22 (first year) + 29 (second year) + 53 (third year) = 104

Ground Truth: First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.
#### 131250
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:
- Trekking bikes sold: 300 bikes * 0.5 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes sold: 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes sold: 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 bikes

2. Calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * ($500/2) = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The frying pan is 20% off of $20.00 so .20*20.00 = $<<20*.01*20=4.00>>4.00
The frying pan costs $20.00 and the discount price is $4.00 so the new price is 20-4=$<<20-4=16.00>>16.00
The towel set is 10% off of $30.00 so .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00
The towel set costs $30.00 and the discount price is $3.00 so the new price is 30-3= $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00
Her new purchases total 16+27 = $$<<16+27=43.00>>43.00
After the return, her card balance was $70.00 and she just added $43.00 in purchases so her new balance is 70+43 = $<<70+43=113.00>>113.00

Ground Truth: On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

Ground Truth: He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1
#### 1
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To answer this question, I will first calculate the total amount spent on movies, popcorn, and candy so far. Then, I will subtract that amount from the total amount given by his parents to see how much he has left to spend. Based on the remaining amount, I will calculate how many movies he can still see on a Friday or Saturday, and how many on other days. Finally, I will take into account the additional popcorn and candy he wants to buy on the last day of the month to determine the total number of movies he can see.

Answer:
After calculating the total amount spent so far, Colby has $56 left to spend. With this amount, he can see 5 more movies on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 more movies on other days. Since he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy on the last day of the month, he can see 1 more movie that night. Therefore, the total number of movies he can see is 14. The answer is 14.

Ground Truth: Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.
#### 5
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total cost of the bacon: $10
2. Calculate the total cost of the chicken: 6 packets x 2 x $10 = $120
3. Calculate the total cost of the strawberries: 3 packs x $4 = $12
4. Calculate the total cost of the apples: 7 packs x 0.5 x $4 = $14
5. Add up the total cost of all items in Kelly's cart: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156
6. Subtract the total cost of all items from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91

The answer is -91

Ground Truth: Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours

Ground Truth: The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.
#### 145
Generated Solution: Strategy:
To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, I will first calculate the arrival times of each train based on the information given. Then, I will determine the time elapsed between the arrival of the third train and the arrival of the fourth train, which is the train Paul needs to get on. Finally, I will add up all the waiting times to find the total amount of time Paul will wait for his train.

Answer:
The total time Paul will wait for his train is 90 minutes.

Ground Truth: The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.
#### 2
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday.
Initial chalk length: 5 inches
Chalk used on Monday: 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches
Chalk remaining after Monday: 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

2. Determine how much chalk the teacher will use each day at 20%.
Chalk used each day: 20% of 5 inches = 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch

3. Divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day to determine how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk.
Days before recycling: 2.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 2.75 days

Answer:
The answer is 2.

Ground Truth: When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500
Car fuel costs him 1/3*$6000 = $<<6000*1/3=2000>>2000
Total expenses amount to $2000+$1500 = $<<2000+1500=3500>>3500
The total amount of money he remains with is $6000-$3500 = $<<6000-3500=2500>>2500
He donates half of the remaining amount, which is 1/2*$2500 = $<<1/2*2500=1250>>1250
The total amount of money given to his wife and daughter is $200+$700 = $<<200+700=900>>900
After the amount that he gave the wife and daughter, the total amount remaining is $1250-$900 = $<<1250-900=350>>350
#### 350
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate how much money Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and donations.
2. Subtract the total expenses from Zaid's salary to find out how much money he has left.
3. Deduct the amount given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount to determine how much money Zaid will still have after all expenses and donations.

Ground Truth: Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.
#### 145
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Start by finding out how many points Betty collected, knowing that she has 30 points more than Tom.
2. Calculate how many points Martha collected, knowing that she collected 3 times more than Tom.
3. Add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom to find the total number of points collected by the class.
4. Subtract the total points collected by the class from the minimum threshold of 400 points to determine how many points are missing for the class to go on the trip.

Ground Truth: First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400
#### 8400
Generated Solution: Strategy:
1. Calculate the total gross income for each job by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours worked for Job A and by adding the annual salary for Job B.
2. Calculate the total tax paid for each job by multiplying the total gross income by the tax rate.
3. Subtract the total tax paid from the total gross income to find the net income for each job.
4. Subtract any additional property tax from the net income for Job B.
5. Compare the net income for both jobs to determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate.
