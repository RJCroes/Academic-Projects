Story 2685ba6d-8b1c-462c-af50-ae5381d64172: Randy looked carefully at the engagement rings in the jewelry store. He noticed a beautiful ring with a large diamond in the center. Randy asked the clerk if he could have a closer look at the ring. The ring was even more gorgeous up close!
Choice 1: Randy bought the ring.
Choice 2: Randy ran away screaming.
Solution: ['Analysis:\nChoice 1: Randy bought the ring. This ending would make sense as it follows the natural progression of the story. Randy showed interest in the ring and found it to be even more beautiful up close. Buying the ring would be a logical next step in this scenario.\n\nChoice 2: Randy ran away screaming. This ending seems unlikely given the context of the story. There is no indication of any negative emotions or events that would prompt Randy to react in such a dramatic manner. It would not make sense for Randy to suddenly run away screaming after expressing interest in the ring.\n\nThe answer is 1']
Story 900e1a7a-c221-4b15-9998-750301bd6a31: Robin went to the gym. She worked out for 2 hours. While at the gym she did arms and abs. She was determined to get in shape.
Choice 1: She continued to work out for the rest of the year.
Choice 2: She went home and ate 3 cartons of ice cream.
Solution: ['Body of Text: \nRobin went to the gym. She worked out for 2 hours. While at the gym she did arms and abs. She was determined to get in shape.\n\nChoice 1: She continued to work out for the rest of the year.\nAnalysis: This ending makes sense as it follows logically from the fact that Robin was determined to get in shape. By continuing to work out for the rest of the year, Robin would be able to achieve her fitness goals and maintain her dedication to improving her health and physique.\n\nChoice 2: She went home and ate 3 cartons of ice cream.\nAnalysis: This ending does not make sense given the context of the text. It goes against the idea that Robin was determined to get in shape, as eating three cartons of ice cream is not a healthy or productive way to achieve fitness goals. It would be an unexpected and contradictory ending to the story.\n\nThe answer is 1']
Story c080b61b-7467-4eb8-8c36-096451d16182: Zack and his friends passed a scary house on their walks to school. One day, they decided to go inside it. Zack and his friends went inside every room. The house was old and abandoned.
Choice 1: They decided to play baseball there.
Choice 2: They left and went to school.
Solution: ['Analysis:\nChoice 1: They decided to play baseball there.\nThis ending does not make much sense in the context of the story. The setting of an old, abandoned house does not seem suitable for playing baseball. It would be strange for the characters to suddenly switch from exploring a creepy house to playing a game like baseball.\n\nChoice 2: They left and went to school.\nThis ending seems more logical and fitting with the context of the story. The characters initially went inside the house out of curiosity, so it would make sense for them to eventually leave and continue on their way to school. It also leaves the story open-ended, allowing the reader to imagine what happens next as they make their way to school.\n\nThe answer is 2']
Story 982d24ef-9aad-48f1-8c8d-c84b60739868: Tim and Gina both hated doing the dishes. They would each alternate which week to do them. Last week Gina wasn't able to get to hers. She had been working longer hours than usual.
Choice 1: Gina was very happy.
Choice 2: Tim did the dishes for Gina to be kind.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: Gina was very happy.\nThis ending does not make sense in the context of the text. There is no indication that Gina's happiness is relevant to the story or that it is a logical conclusion to the situation presented.\n\nChoice 2: Tim did the dishes for Gina to be kind.\nThis ending makes the most sense to complete the text with. It follows logically from the setup of the story, where Gina was unable to do her share of the dishes due to working longer hours. Tim doing the dishes for Gina out of kindness would be a natural resolution to the situation and would provide a sense of closure to the story.\n\nThe answer is 2"]
Story b06feba7-f225-41a3-a744-e732218a1d0a: James was at the gym playing basketball. His clothes were soaked from running up and down the court. He forgot to bring spare clothes to change into. James had to run to his car in order to avoid the cold weather.
Choice 1: James drove home with the car window open.
Choice 2: James drove home to get change into dry clothes.
Solution: ['Analysis:\nChoice 1: James driving home with the car window open seems unlikely as he had just mentioned running to his car to avoid the cold weather. It would not make sense for him to drive home with the window open in such conditions.\nChoice 2: James driving home to change into dry clothes is the more logical choice as it follows the sequence of events in the text. Since he forgot to bring spare clothes and his clothes were soaked, it would make sense for him to drive home to change into dry clothes.\n\nAnswer:\nThe answer is 2']
Story 58429e2f-3bc1-497a-ab9b-13f0b840d7ea: The girls decided to get together for dinner. They brought their families too. Unfortunately they got into a fight. The staff had to throw them out.
Choice 1: The girls were thoroughly embarrassed.
Choice 2: The girls had a great time.
Solution: ['Analysis:\nChoice 1: The girls were thoroughly embarrassed.\nThis ending would make sense as it follows the negative tone set by the fact that the girls got into a fight and were thrown out of the restaurant. It would provide a sense of consequence to their actions and show that they regret their behavior.\n\nChoice 2: The girls had a great time.\nThis ending would not make sense as it contradicts the events that unfolded in the text. The fact that the girls got into a fight and were thrown out of the restaurant does not align with the idea that they had a great time. It would feel out of place and inconsistent with the rest of the story.\n\nThe answer is 1']
Story 953792ed-bd0a-4c95-bc6c-7965187afd82: Brian was excited for the talent show. He had been doing extra practice on his drums. To express his individuality he wore a skirt on stage. When he finished his act he got a standing ovation.
Choice 1: Brian was very creative and brave.
Choice 2: Brian was not very creative.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: This ending fits well with the text as it acknowledges Brian's creativity and bravery in choosing to wear a skirt on stage to express his individuality. It also aligns with the fact that he received a standing ovation, indicating that his act was well-received by the audience.\n\nChoice 2: This ending does not make sense in the context of the text. It contradicts the fact that Brian received a standing ovation, which suggests that he was successful in his performance. Additionally, it does not acknowledge Brian's decision to wear a skirt as a form of expressing his individuality, which was a key aspect of the text.\n\nThe answer is 1."]
Story bf150607-566f-47f3-b180-49d4d5f87cb8: Sarah had an appointment to interview for a job. She put on her best skirt suit and headed to the interview. As she sat at the interview, Sarah noticed a run in her stockings. She was so focused on the flaw, she merely mumbled her replies.
Choice 1: Because of her replies, Sarah didn't get the job.
Choice 2: Sarah got the job and was praised for her clear voice.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: Because of her replies, Sarah didn't get the job.\nThis ending suggests that Sarah's lack of confidence and focus on the flaw in her stockings negatively impacted her performance during the interview, resulting in her not getting the job.\n\nChoice 2: Sarah got the job and was praised for her clear voice.\nThis ending provides a more positive outcome for Sarah, indicating that she was able to overcome her nerves and make a good impression during the interview, ultimately leading to her getting the job.\n\nThe answer is 2"]
Story 76962d77-c956-49ba-a135-427a6e78d0e0: Tommy recently landed a position on his school's Debate team. They were having a debate tonight. He was pretty nervous. When he got there, the entire school was watching.
Choice 1: Tommy started playing guitar.
Choice 2: Tommy ended up doing well regardless of his nerves.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: Tommy started playing guitar.\nThis ending does not make sense in the context of the text as it does not provide any resolution to Tommy's nerves or the debate situation. It seems like a random action that is not connected to the established plot.\n\nChoice 2: Tommy ended up doing well regardless of his nerves.\nThis ending makes the most sense as it provides closure to the established plot. It resolves the tension and anxiety Tommy was feeling about the debate and shows his growth and ability to overcome his nerves. It also ties in well with the initial setup of Tommy landing a position on the Debate team.\n\nAnswer:\nThe answer is 2"]
Story 49c51e74-be6e-45b9-a223-4c0835ad76c1: Scott knew someone was stealing packages from his porch. He set up a surveillance camera near his door. He felt that he would at least have a video of the thief. One day, Scott saw footage of the perpetrator.
Choice 1: Scott gave him a high five.
Choice 2: Scott apprehended the perpetrator.
Solution: ['Analysis:\nChoice 1: Scott gave him a high five.\nThis ending does not make sense in the context of the text. It seems unlikely that Scott would congratulate the thief for stealing packages from his porch. It goes against common sense and the idea of justice being served.\n\nChoice 2: Scott apprehended the perpetrator.\nThis ending makes the most sense to complete the text. It follows logically from the setup of Scott setting up a surveillance camera to catch the thief. Apprehending the perpetrator would provide closure to the situation and potentially prevent further thefts from occurring.\n\nThe answer is 2']
Story 56b2b948-79eb-4a8f-89bd-bd7198c50546: Christian's school was starting football tryouts. Christian decided to try out for the team. He practiced every day. He tried out for the team.
Choice 1: Christian hates football.
Choice 2: Christian got on the team.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: If Christian hates football, it would not make sense for him to try out for the team in the first place. This choice would contradict the initial actions of the character and would not provide a logical conclusion to the story.\nChoice 2: If Christian got on the team, it would be a natural progression from his decision to try out and practice every day. This choice would provide a satisfying and logical conclusion to the story, showing Christian's hard work paying off.\n\nAnswer:\nThe answer is 2"]
Story a99209f1-2b57-4b5e-9216-0606cc005e90: When I was five, I moved. I had to go to a new school. I felt lonely on my first day. A kid walked up to me and introduced himself.
Choice 1: I felt less lonely.
Choice 2: I felt more lonely.
Solution: ["Body of Text: When I was five, I moved. I had to go to a new school. I felt lonely on my first day. A kid walked up to me and introduced himself.\n\nChoice 1: I felt less lonely.\nAnalysis: This ending would provide a positive resolution to the initial feeling of loneliness the narrator experienced on their first day at the new school. It suggests that the introduction from the new kid helped alleviate some of the loneliness and made the narrator feel more comfortable in their new environment.\n\nChoice 2: I felt more lonely.\nAnalysis: This ending would create a sense of continued isolation for the narrator, despite the introduction from the new kid. It would suggest that the interaction did not have a positive impact on the narrator's feelings of loneliness, potentially leading to a more negative outlook on their new school and surroundings.\n\nThe answer is 1"]
Story 1bed450a-2a30-4431-84d3-1361cd1423da: Renee was inspired by the music of Eddie Van Halen. She decided to learn to play guitar. She bought an electric guitar and an amp. She hated pressing the strings with her fingers.
Choice 1: Renee decided she would have to get used to it.
Choice 2: Renee was glad she decided to learn to play drums.
Solution: ['Analysis:\nChoice 1: Renee decided she would have to get used to it.\nThis ending implies that Renee is determined to push through the initial discomfort of pressing the guitar strings with her fingers in order to achieve her goal of learning to play the guitar. It shows her commitment and perseverance in pursuing her passion for music.\n\nChoice 2: Renee was glad she decided to learn to play drums.\nThis ending takes an unexpected turn, as it suggests that Renee decides to switch instruments and learn to play the drums instead of the guitar. While this choice could add an element of surprise to the story, it does not directly address the initial challenge of pressing the guitar strings with her fingers.\n\nThe answer is 1']
Story f15ddccd-7a21-45c3-ab3f-241ef3b2e4d3: My mother has a recipe for pumpkin bars that I like quite a lot. She once made them for me because I was having a bad day. I ate the pumpkin bars and I felt much better. The bars reminded me that my mother cares about me.
Choice 1: I never ate pumpkin bars after that day.
Choice 2: I made pumpkin bars later in life and they reminded me of my mom.
Solution: ['Analysis:\nChoice 1: If the text ends with "I never ate pumpkin bars after that day," it would create a sense of finality to the story. It implies that the experience with the pumpkin bars was a one-time event and holds a negative connotation towards them. This ending suggests a disconnection from the memory of the mother\'s caring gesture.\nChoice 2: Ending the text with "I made pumpkin bars later in life and they reminded me of my mom," provides a sense of continuation and growth in the story. It shows that the protagonist has taken a positive experience from the past and incorporated it into their own life. This ending reinforces the idea of the mother\'s care and the impact it had on the protagonist.\n\nThe answer is 2']
Story 4bcf69b5-f500-4f3d-b633-ec780499a567: Don's friend pulled Don's pants down in front of his graduating class. Don was angry and embarrassed at being exposed in this way. Don decided that this friend would no longer be his friend. Don's shame and embarrassment grew.
Choice 1: Don laughs at the experience.
Choice 2: Don never forgave his friend.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: Don laughs at the experience.\nThis ending would not make sense as it does not align with Don's initial reaction of being angry and embarrassed. Laughing at the experience would imply that Don is not affected by the incident, which contradicts the feelings of shame and embarrassment that he initially felt.\n\nChoice 2: Don never forgave his friend.\nThis ending makes the most sense as it follows the trajectory of the story. Don's initial reaction of anger and embarrassment would likely lead to a strained or broken friendship with the friend who exposed him in front of his graduating class. The unresolved conflict between Don and his friend would also contribute to Don's feelings of shame and embarrassment growing over time.\n\nThe answer is 2"]
Story 2a5347ad-a91c-42c3-86a2-b8e3edcdb4b0: Jim lost his wallet that had all of his money it. He would have no more money for food for his family until next month. Meanwhile, Pete found a wallet lying in the bank parking lot. It contained hundreds of dollars and Pete really wanted a new TV.
Choice 1: Pete kept the wallet and donated the money to charity.
Choice 2: So, Pete kept the wallet and bought a new TV with the money.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: Pete kept the wallet and donated the money to charity.\nThis ending would provide a positive resolution to the story by showing Pete's selfless act of donating the money to charity. It would also highlight the theme of kindness and generosity, potentially teaching a moral lesson to the readers.\n\nChoice 2: So, Pete kept the wallet and bought a new TV with the money.\nThis ending would provide a more negative resolution to the story as Pete chooses to prioritize his desire for a new TV over doing the right thing by returning the wallet or donating the money. It would depict Pete in a selfish light and potentially leave a negative impression on the readers.\n\nThe answer is 1"]
Story 10770264-1216-4bf9-a955-423d82dc6a92: It was a bright, warm day. So Joe thought it would be nice to take a walk. He decided to walk to his local coffee shop. But halfway there, he started getting tired.
Choice 1: So he ran to the coffee shop.

Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: So he ran to the coffee shop.\nThis ending provides a resolution to the initial conflict of Joe getting tired halfway to the coffee shop. By running, Joe is able to reach his destination faster and overcome his fatigue. It gives a sense of determination and proactiveness on Joe's part.\n\nChoice 2: Joe regret going outside.\nThis ending leaves the story on a negative note, with Joe regretting his decision to go outside. It does not provide any resolution to the initial conflict and leaves the reader with a sense of disappointment. It does not tie up the loose ends of the story effectively.\n\nThe answer is 1"]
Story b090fb07-e7fd-4c01-ad85-38016522a727: Beth was taking a shower when she heard a loud knock on the door. She didn't want to answer and waited for it to go away. The next time she took a shower, she heard the loud knock again. But when she rushed out of the shower to answer, no one was there.
Choice 1: Beth decided she was hearing things.
Choice 2: Beth was deaf.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: If Beth decided she was hearing things, it would imply that the loud knocks were just a figment of her imagination. This would add a mysterious and eerie element to the story, leaving the reader wondering about the true cause of the knocks.\nChoice 2: If Beth was deaf, it would explain why she didn't hear the knocks when she rushed out of the shower to answer. This would provide a logical explanation for the situation, but it might not have the same impact as the mysterious and eerie feel of choice 1.\n\nAnswer:\nThe answer is 1"]
Story a9edad89-7ad4-4655-9aae-e1aec3a4a7df: A little girl wanted a puppy. Her parents told her no. She started to cry. She cried and cried until her parents caved.
Choice 1: They went to the animal shelter and picked out a cute puppy.
Choice 2: They went to the pet store and bought a bird.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: They went to the animal shelter and picked out a cute puppy.\nThis choice makes sense as it follows the initial desire of the little girl to have a puppy. It also shows that the parents ultimately gave in to her request and fulfilled her wish.\n\nChoice 2: They went to the pet store and bought a bird.\nThis choice does not make as much sense as the first one, as it deviates from the little girl's initial desire for a puppy. It also does not provide a satisfying resolution to the story of the little girl wanting a puppy and her parents eventually giving in.\n\nThe answer is 1"]
Story b121d09f-138e-4729-b40c-4f2929f3537c: A scientist discovers that there is a disease beginning to spread. He works on a cure for the disease in his lab. Other scientists gather to help him with his work. Several weeks go by and they manage to develop a cure.
Choice 1: They feel foolish for having done so.
Choice 2: They save the world.
Solution: ["Analysis:\nChoice 1: They feel foolish for having done so. This ending does not make sense given the context of the text. The scientists have worked hard to develop a cure for the spreading disease, so feeling foolish would contradict their efforts and the accomplishment of finding a cure.\nChoice 2: They save the world. This ending makes the most sense to complete the text with. It ties back to the initial problem introduced in the text - the spreading disease - and provides a resolution to the conflict. It also highlights the importance and impact of the scientists' work in developing the cure.\n\nAnswer:\nThe answer is 2"]
